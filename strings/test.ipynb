      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When the Pilgrim first landed on the coast of America, the most\n",
      "remarkable feature of its scenery that drew his attention, next to the\n",
      "absence of towns and villages, was an almost universal forest. A few\n",
      "openings were to be seen near the rivers,â€”immense peat-meadows covered\n",
      "with wild bushes and gramineous plants, interspersed with little wooded\n",
      "islets, and bordered on all sides by a rugged, silent, and dreary desert\n",
      "of woods. Partial clearings had likewise been made by the Indians for\n",
      "their rude hamlets, and some spaces had been opened by fire. But the\n",
      "greater part of the country was darkened by an umbrageous mass of trees\n",
      "and shrubbery, in whose gloomy shades were ever present dangers and\n",
      "bewilderment for the traveller. In these solitudes the axe of the\n",
      "woodman had never been heard, and the forest for thousands of years had\n",
      "been subject only to the spontaneous action of natural causes. To men\n",
      "who had been accustomed to the open and cultivated plains of Europe,\n",
      "this waste of woods, those hills without prospect, that pathless\n",
      "wilderness, and its inhabitants as savage as the aspect of the country,\n",
      "must have seemed equally sublime and terrible.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when the colonists had cut roads through this desert, planted\n",
      "landmarks over the country, built houses upon its clearings, opened the\n",
      "hill-tops to a view of the surrounding prospect, and cheered the\n",
      "solitude by some gleams of civilization, then came the naturalist and\n",
      "the man of science to survey the aspect and productions of this new\n",
      "world. And when they made their first excursions over its rugged hills\n",
      "and through its wooded vales, we can easily imagine their transports at\n",
      "the sight of its peculiar scenery. How must the early botanist have\n",
      "exulted over this grand assemblage of plants, that bore resemblance to\n",
      "those of Europe only as the wild Indian resembles the fair-haired Saxon!\n",
      "Everywhere some rare herb put forth flowers at his feet, and trees of\n",
      "magnificent height and slender proportions intercepted his progress by\n",
      "their crowded numbers. The wood was so generally uninterrupted, that it\n",
      "was difficult to find a summit from which he could obtain a lookout of\n",
      "any considerable extent; but occasional natural openings exposed floral\n",
      "scenes that must have seemed like the work of enchantment. In the wet\n",
      "meadows were deep beds of moss of the finest verdure, which had seldom\n",
      "been disturbed by man or brute. On the uplands were vast fields of the\n",
      "checkerberry plant, social, like the European heath, and loaded half the\n",
      "year with its spicy scarlet fruit. Every valley presented some unknown\n",
      "vegetation to his sight, and every tangled path led him into a new scene\n",
      "of beauties and wonders. It must have seemed to him, when traversing\n",
      "this strange wilderness, that he had entered upon a new earth, in which\n",
      "nature had imitated, without repeating, the productions of his native\n",
      "East.\n",
      "\n",
      "Along the level parts of New England and the adjacent country, wherever\n",
      "the rivers were languid in their course, and partially inundated their\n",
      "banks in the spring, were frequent natural meadows, not covered by\n",
      "trees,â€”the homes of the robin and the bobolink before the white man had\n",
      "opened to them new fields for their subsistence. In the borders of these\n",
      "openings, the woods in early summer were filled with a sweet and novel\n",
      "minstrelsy, contrasting delightfully with the silence of the deeper\n",
      "forest. The notes of the birds were wild variations of those which were\n",
      "familiar to the Pilgrim in his native land, and inspired him with\n",
      "delight amidst the all-prevailing sadness of woods that presented on the\n",
      "one hand scenes both grand and beautiful, and teemed on the other with\n",
      "horrors which only the pioneer of the desert could describe.\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole continent, at the time of its discovery, from the coast to the\n",
      "Great American Desert, was one vast hunting-ground, where the nomadic\n",
      "inhabitants obtained their subsistence from the chase of countless herds\n",
      "of deer and buffalo. At this period the climate had not been modified by\n",
      "the operations of man upon the forest. It was less variable than now,\n",
      "and the temperature corresponded more definitely with the degrees of\n",
      "latitude. The winter was a season of more invariable cold, less\n",
      "interrupted by thaws. In New England and the other Northern States, snow\n",
      "fell in the early part of December, and lay on the ground until April,\n",
      "when the spring opened suddenly, and was not followed by those\n",
      "vicissitudes that mark the season at the present era. Such was the true\n",
      "forest climate. May-day came garlanded with flowers, lighted with\n",
      "sunshine, and breathing the odors of a true spring. It was then easy to\n",
      "foretell what the next season would be from its character the preceding\n",
      "years. Autumn was not then, as we have often seen it, extended into\n",
      "winter. The limits of each season were more precisely defined. The\n",
      "continent was annually visited by the Indian summer, that came, without\n",
      "fail, immediately after the fall of the leaf and the first hard frosts\n",
      "of November. This short season of mild and serene weather, the halcyon\n",
      "period of autumn, has disappeared with the primitive forest.\n",
      "\n",
      "The original circumstances of the country have been entirely\n",
      "revolutionized. The American climate is now in that transition state\n",
      "which has been caused by opening the space to the winds from all\n",
      "quarters by operations which have not yet been carried to their extreme\n",
      "limit. These changes of the surface have probably increased the mean\n",
      "annual temperature of the whole country by permitting the direct rays of\n",
      "the sun to act upon a wider area, while they have multiplied those\n",
      "eccentricities of climate that balk our weather calculations at all\n",
      "seasons. There are still in many parts of the country large tracts of\n",
      "wood which have not been greatly disturbed. From the observation of\n",
      "these, and from descriptions by different writers of the last century,\n",
      "we may form a pretty fair estimate of the character and aspect of the\n",
      "forest before it was invaded by civilized man.\n",
      "\n",
      "During this primitive condition of the country, the forest, having been\n",
      "left for centuries entirely to nature, would have formed a very\n",
      "intelligible geological chart. If we could have taken an extensive view\n",
      "of the New England forest, before any considerable inroads had been made\n",
      "by the early settlers, from an elevated stand on the coast, we should\n",
      "have beheld a dense and almost universal covering of trees. From this\n",
      "stand we might also trace the geological character of the soil, and its\n",
      "different degrees of fertility, dryness, and moisture, by the\n",
      "predominance of certain species and the absence of others. The\n",
      "undulations upon this vast ocean of foliage would come from the\n",
      "elevations and depressions of the ground; for the varying heights of the\n",
      "different assemblages of species upon the same level could hardly be\n",
      "perceived by a distant view. The lowest parts of this wooded region were\n",
      "at that period covered very generally with a crowded growth of the\n",
      "northern cypress, or white cedar. These evergreen swamps would\n",
      "constitute the darkest ground of the picture. The deep alluvial tracts\n",
      "would be known by the deciduous character of their woods and their\n",
      "lighter and brighter verdure, and the dry, sandy and diluvial plains and\n",
      "the gravelly hills and eminences by their white birches and tremulous\n",
      "poplars, their stunted pitch-pines and dwarfish junipers. For a century\n",
      "past the woods have been cleared mostly from the alluvial tracts; and\n",
      "the oaks, the hickories, the chestnuts, and other hard-wood trees, the\n",
      "primitive occupants of the rich and deep soils, have been succeeded in\n",
      "great measure by trees of softer wood, that originally grew on inferior\n",
      "land. The wooded aspect of the country cannot any longer be considered,\n",
      "as formerly, a good geological chart, except in some parts of Maine and\n",
      "the adjoining British Provinces.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the conditions most remarkable in a primitive forest is the\n",
      "universal dampness of the ground. The second growth of timber,\n",
      "especially if the surface were entirely cleared, stands upon a drier\n",
      "foundation. This greater dryness is caused by the absence of those vast\n",
      "accumulations of vegetable _dÃ©bris_ that rested on the ground before it\n",
      "was disturbed. A greater evaporation also takes place under the second\n",
      "growth, because the trees are of inferior size and stand more widely\n",
      "apart. Another character of a primitive forest is the crowded assemblage\n",
      "of trees and their undergrowth, causing great difficulty in traversing\n",
      "it. Innumerable straggling vines, many of them covered with thorns, like\n",
      "the green-brier, intercept our way. Immense trunks of trees, prostrated\n",
      "by hurricanes, lie in our path, and beds of moss of extreme thickness\n",
      "cover a great part of the surface, saturated with moisture. The trees\n",
      "are also covered with mosses, generated by the shade and dampness; and\n",
      "woody vines, like the climbing fern, the poison ivy, and the ampelopsis,\n",
      "fastened upon their trunks and trailing from their branches, make the\n",
      "wood in many places like the interior of a grotto. Above all, the\n",
      "traveller would notice the absence of those pleasant wood-paths that\n",
      "intersect all our familiar woods, and would find his way only by\n",
      "observing those natural appearances that serve as a compass to the\n",
      "Indian and the forester.\n",
      "\n",
      "In primitive woods there is but a small proportion of perfectly formed\n",
      "trees; and these occur only in such places as permit some individuals to\n",
      "stand in an isolated position, and spread out their arms to their full\n",
      "capacity. When rambling in a wood we take note of several conditions\n",
      "which are favorable to this full expansion of their forms. On the\n",
      "borders of a lake, a prairie, or an open moor, or of an extensive quarry\n",
      "that projects above the soil, the trees will extend their branches into\n",
      "the opening; but as they are crowded on their inner side, they are only\n",
      "half developed. This expansion, however, is on the side that is exposed\n",
      "to view; hence the incomparable beauty of a wood on the borders of a\n",
      "lake or pond, on the banks of a river as viewed from the water, and on\n",
      "the circumference of a densely wooded islet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fissures and cavities are frequent in large rocks not covered with soil,\n",
      "allowing solitary trees which have taken root in them to acquire their\n",
      "full proportions. In such places, and on eminences that rise suddenly\n",
      "above the forest level, with precipitous sides, overtopping the\n",
      "surrounding woods, we find individual trees possessing the character of\n",
      "standards, like those we see by roadsides and in open fields. But\n",
      "perfectly formed trees can only be produced in openings and on isolated\n",
      "elevations such as I have described; and it is evident that these\n",
      "favorable circumstances must be rare. The trees in a forest are like\n",
      "those human beings who from their infancy have been confined in the\n",
      "workshops of a crowded manufacturing town, and who become closely\n",
      "assimilated and lose those marks of individual character by which they\n",
      "would be distinguished if they had been reared in a state of freedom and\n",
      "in the open country.\n",
      "\n",
      "The primitive forest, in spite of its dampness, has always been subject\n",
      "to fires in dry seasons, which have sometimes extended over immense\n",
      "tracts of country. These fires were the dread of the early settlers, and\n",
      "countless lives have been destroyed by their flames often overwhelming\n",
      "entire villages. At the present time the causes of fire in the woods are\n",
      "very numerous; but before they were exposed to artificial sources of\n",
      "ignition it may have arisen from spontaneous combustion, caused by large\n",
      "accumulations of fermenting substances, or from lightning, or from the\n",
      "accidental friction of the trunks of half-prostrated trees crossing each\n",
      "other, and moved by a high wind. The forests in every part of the world\n",
      "have been subject to conflagrations; and there seems to be no other\n",
      "means that could be used by nature for removing old and worn-out\n",
      "forests, which contain more combustible materials than any young woods.\n",
      "The burned tracts in America are called barrens by the inhabitants; and\n",
      "as the vegetation on the surface is often entirely destroyed, the\n",
      "spontaneous renewal of it would display the gradual method of nature in\n",
      "restoring the forest. The successions of plants, from the beautiful\n",
      "crimson fireweed, through all the gradations of tender herbs, prickly\n",
      "bushes, and brambles, to shrubs and trees of inferior stature, until\n",
      "all, if the soil be deep and fertile, are supplanted by oaks, chestnuts,\n",
      "hickories, and other hard-wood trees, are as regular and determinable as\n",
      "the courses of the planets or the orders of the seasons.\n",

      "                                THE ASH.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It is interesting to note the changes that take place from one season to\n",
      "another in the comparative beauty of certain trees. The Ash, for\n",
      "example, during the early part of October, is one of the most beautiful\n",
      "trees of the forest, exceeded only by the maple in variety of tinting.\n",
      "In summer, too, but few trees surpass it in quality of foliage, disposed\n",
      "in flowing irregular masses, light and airy, but not thin, though\n",
      "allowing the branches to be traced through it, even to their\n",
      "extremities. It has a well-rounded head, neither so regular as to be\n",
      "formal, nor so broken as to detract from its peculiar grace. When\n",
      "standing with other trees in midsummer, in the border of a wood, or\n",
      "mingled with the standards by the roadside, the Ash would be sure to\n",
      "attract admiration. But no sooner have the leaves fallen from its\n",
      "branches than it takes rank below almost all other trees, presenting a\n",
      "stiff, blunt, and awkward spray, and an entire want of that elegance it\n",
      "affects at other seasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ash is a favorite in Europe, though deficient there in autumnal\n",
      "tints. It is a tree of the first magnitude, and has been styled in\n",
      "classical poetry the Venus of the forest, from the general beauty of its\n",
      "proportions and flowing robes. The English, however, complain of the\n",
      "Ash, on account of its tardy leafing in the spring and its premature\n",
      "denudation in the autumn. â€œIts leaf,â€ says Gilpin, â€œis much tenderer\n",
      "than that of the oak, and sooner receives impression from the winds and\n",
      "frost. Instead of contributing its tint, therefore, in the wane of the\n",
      "year, among the many colored offspring of the woods, it shrinks from the\n",
      "blast, drops its leaf, and in each scene where it predominates leaves\n",
      "wide blanks of desolate boughs amid foliage yet fresh and verdant.\n",
      "Before its decay we sometimes see its leaf tinged with a fine yellow,\n",
      "well contrasted with the neighboring greens. But this is one of natureâ€™s\n",
      "casual beauties. Much oftener its leaf decays in a dark, muddy,\n",
      "unpleasing tint.â€\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ash is remarkable for a certain trimness and regularity of\n",
      "proportion, and it seldom displays any of those breaks so conspicuous in\n",
      "the outlines of the hickory, which in many points it resembles. The\n",
      "trunk rises to more than an average height before it is subdivided; but\n",
      "we do not see the central shaft above this subdivision, as in the poplar\n",
      "and the fir. Lateral branches seldom shoot from the trunk, save, as I\n",
      "have sometimes observed, a sort of bushy growth, surrounding it a little\n",
      "below the angles made by the lower branches. It is called in Europe â€œthe\n",
      "paintersâ€™ tree.â€ But George Barnard, alluding to this fact, remarks:\n",
      "â€œUnlike the oak, the Ash does not increase in picturesqueness with old\n",
      "age. The foliage becomes rare and meagre, and its branches, instead of\n",
      "hanging loosely, often start away in disagreeable forms.â€\n",
      "\n",
      "North America contains a greater number of species of the genus\n",
      "_Fraxinus_ than any other part of the globe. But three of these only are\n",
      "common in New England,â€”the white, the red, and the black Ash. The first\n",
      "is the most frequent both in the forest and by the roadsides, the most\n",
      "beautiful, and the most valuable for its timber. All the species have\n",
      "pinnate and opposite leaves, and opposite branches in all the recent\n",
      "growth; but as the tree increases in size, one of the two invariably\n",
      "becomes abortive, so that we perceive this opposite character only in\n",
      "the spray. The leaflets are mostly in sevens, not so large nor so\n",
      "unequal as in the similar foliage of the hickory.\n",
      "\n",
      "The white and the red Ash have so nearly the same external characters,\n",
      "that it requires some study to distinguish them. They do not differ in\n",
      "their ramification, nor in their autumnal hues. The black Ash may be\n",
      "readily identified by the leaves, which are sessile, and like those of\n",
      "the elder; also by the dark bluish color of the buds and newly formed\n",
      "branches, and the slenderness of its proportions. It seldom attains a\n",
      "great height or size, and is chiefly confined to swamps and muddy soils.\n",
      "The wood of this species is remarkable for strength and elasticity. The\n",
      "remarks of George Barnard respecting the localities of the Ash in Europe\n",
      "will apply to the American species: â€œThough seen everywhere, its\n",
      "favorite haunt is the mountain stream, where its branches hang\n",
      "gracefully over the water, adding much beauty to the scene. It is to be\n",
      "met with in every romantic glen and glade, now clinging with\n",
      "half-covered roots to a steep, overhanging cliff, and breaking with its\n",
      "light, elegant foliage the otherwise too abrupt line, or with its soft\n",
      "warm green relieving the monotonous coloring of the rocks or the sombre\n",
      "gray of some old ruin.â€\n",
      "\n",
      "There are some remarkable superstitions and traditionary notions\n",
      "connected with the Ash-tree. The idea that it is offensive, and even\n",
      "fatal, to serpents, is not of modern origin, though not a rustic laborer\n",
      "can be found who would not consider an Ash-tree planted before his house\n",
      "as a charm against their intrusion. According to Pliny, if a serpent be\n",
      "surrounded on one side by fire and on the other by a barricade of the\n",
      "leaves and branches of the Ash-tree, he will escape through the fire,\n",
      "rather than through its fatal boughs. It is related in the Edda that man\n",
      "was first created from the wood of this tree, and it is not improbable\n",
      "that this superstition has some connection with the fable of Adam and\n",
      "Eve, and through this with the supposed antipathy of the serpent for the\n",
      "Ash-tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a saying in Great Britain, that, if the Ash puts forth its\n",
      "leaves before the oak, the following summer will be wet; but if the\n",
      "leafing of the oak precedes that of the Ash, it will be dry. I am not\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "European travellers in this country frequently allude to the American\n",
      "forest as remarkable for its solitude and deficiency of animal life.\n",
      "Captain Hardy remarks that a foreigner is struck with surprise, when\n",
      "rambling through the bush, at the scarcity of birds, rabbits, and hares,\n",
      "and is astonished when in the deepest recesses of the wild country he\n",
      "sees but little increase of their numbers. When paddling his canoe\n",
      "through lake and river, he will startle but few pairs of exceedingly\n",
      "timid waterfowl where in Europe they swarm in multitudes. This scarcity\n",
      "of animals, I would remark, is not peculiar to the American wilderness.\n",
      "The same fact has been observed in extensive forests both in Europe and\n",
      "Asia; and in proportion as the traveller penetrates into their interiors\n",
      "he finds a smaller number of animals of almost every species. Birds,\n",
      "insects, and quadrupeds will multiply, like human beings, in a certain\n",
      "ratio with the progress of agriculture, so long as there remains a\n",
      "sufficiency of wild wood to afford them a refuge and a home. They use\n",
      "the forest chiefly for shelter, and the open grounds for forage; the\n",

      "observation. After passing a few weeks of the winter in Nashville, I\n",
      "directed my course through Tennessee and Virginia, and was often led\n",

      "is very remarkable that all over the globe they discover an instinct\n",
      "which attracts them to the habitations of man. If there be but a single\n",

      "seeds already planted there; but the white birch and poplar, especially\n",
      "the large American aspen, usually predominate in clearings in this part\n",
      "of the country. When a pine wood is felled, it is succeeded by an\n",
      "inferior growth of conifers, and a species of dwarf or scrub oak.\n",
      "Seldom, indeed, after any kind of wood has been cut down and carried\n",
      "away from the spot, can the exhausted soil support another that is not\n",
      "inferior in quality or species. Though an oak wood may be succeeded by\n",
      "pines, a pine wood will not be succeeded by oaks or any other hard\n",
      "timber, unless the trees were burned and their ashes restored to the\n",
      "soil. Hence we may account for the fact that poplars, white birches, and\n",
      "wild-cherry-trees, occupy a larger proportion of the ground that is now\n",
      "covered with wood than they did a century ago, in all parts of the\n",
      "country.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have already alluded to the well-known fact, that the generic\n",
      "character of the timber, in the distribution of the primitive forest, in\n",
      "any country, is determined in great measure by the geological character\n",
      "of the soil. On sandy plains in the primitive forest, the white birch,\n",
      "the poplar, the aspen, and the pitch pine were abundant, as they are now\n",
      "on similar soils. The preference of the red maple for wet and miry soils\n",
      "is well known; while hard maple, oak, beech, and hickory do not prosper\n",
      "except in strong alluvial tracts. A heavy growth of hard timber\n",
      "indicates a superior soil; pine indicates an inferior one, if it has\n",
      "been left to the spontaneous action of nature. In the primitive forest\n",
      "we were sure of finding such relations of soil and species. They are not\n",
      "so invariable since the operations of agriculture have interrupted the\n",
      "true method of nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a wood has been burned, the process of renewal, when left to\n",
      "nature, is much more tardy than if it had been felled, since it can now\n",
      "be restored only by a regular series of vegetable species, which must\n",
      "precede it, according to certain inevitable laws. The soil, however,\n",
      "being improved and fertilized by the ashes of the burnt timber, is in a\n",
      "chemical condition to support a luxuriant forest as soon as in the\n",
      "course of nature it can be planted there. Trees will not immediately\n",
      "come up from this burnt ground as in a clearing; and if they should\n",
      "appear, they would mostly perish from the want of protection. In the\n",
      "order of nature herbaceous plants are the first to occupy the soil, and\n",
      "these are followed by a uniform succession of different species. There\n",
      "is an epilobium, or willow herb, with elegant spikes of purple flowers,\n",
      "conspicuous in our meadows in August, which is one of the earliest\n",
      "occupants of burnt ground, hence called fireweed in Maine and Nova\n",
      "Scotia. The downy appendage to its seeds causes it to be planted there\n",
      "by the winds immediately after the burning. The trillium appears also in\n",
      "great abundance upon the blackened surface of the ground in all wet\n",
      "places. Plants like the ginseng, the erythronium, and the like, whose\n",
      "bulbs or tubers lie buried deep in the mould, escape destruction, and\n",
      "come up anew. These, along with several compound plants with downy\n",
      "seeds, and a few ferns and equisetums, are the first occupants of burnt\n",
      "lands.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the plants mentioned above have no tendency to foster the growth of\n",
      "young trees. They are, however, succeeded by the thistles and thorny\n",
      "plants, which are natureâ€™s preparation of any tract, once entirely\n",
      "stripped of vegetation, as a nursery for the seedlings. All the\n",
      "phenomena of natureâ€™s rotation are but the necessary giving place of\n",
      "rapid-growing and short-lived plants to others which are perennial and\n",
      "more capable of maintaining their ground after being once planted.\n",
      "Thorns and thistles soon appear on burnt lands, and protect the young\n",
      "trees as they spring up, both from the winds and the browsing of\n",
      "animals. Thus many an oak has been nursed in a cradle of thorns and\n",
      "brambles, and many a lime-tree growing in a bower of eglantine has been\n",
      "protected by its thorns from the browsing of the goat.\n",
      "\n",
      "We very early discover a variety of those woody plants that bear an\n",
      "edible fruit, which is eaten by birds and scattered by them over the\n",
      "land, including many species of bramble. The fruit-bearing shrubs always\n",
      "precede the fruit-bearing trees; but the burnt land is first occupied by\n",
      "those kinds that bear a stone-fruit. Hence great numbers of cherry-trees\n",
      "and wild-plum-trees are found there, as the natural successors of the\n",
      "wild gooseberry and bramble-bushes. These are soon mixed with poplars,\n",
      "limes, and other trees with volatile seeds. But oaks, hickories, and the\n",
      "nut-bearing trees must wait to be planted by squirrels and field-mice\n",
      "and some species of birds. The nut-bearers, therefore, will be the last\n",
      "to appear in a burnt region, for the little quadrupeds that feed upon\n",
      "their fruit will not frequent this spot until it is well covered with\n",
      "shrubbery and other vegetation. If the soil be adapted to the growth of\n",
      "heavy timber, the superior kinds, like the oak, the beech, and the hard\n",
      "maple, will gradually starve out the inferior species, and in the course\n",
      "of time predominate over the whole surface.\n",

      "assured, if the latter were destroyed that plant their seeds, many\n",
      "species would perish and disappear from the face of the earth. Nature\n",
      "has provided, in all cases, against the destruction of plants, by\n",
      "endowing the animals that consume their fruits with certain habits that\n",
      "tend to perpetuate and preserve them. In this way they make amends for\n",
      "the vast quantities they consume. After the squirrels and jays have\n",
      "hoarded nuts for future use, they do not find all their stores; and they\n",
      "sow by these accidents more seeds than could have been planted by other\n",
      "accidental means, if no living creature fed upon them. Animals are not\n",
      "more dependent on the fruit of these trees for their subsistence, than\n",
      "the trees are upon them for the continuance of their species. And it is\n",
      "pleasant to note that, while plants depend on insects for the\n",
      "fertilization of their flowers, they are equally indebted to a higher\n",
      "order of animals for planting their seeds. The wasteful habits of\n",
      "animals are an important means for promoting this end. The fruit of the\n",
      "oak, the hickory, and the chestnut will soon decay if it lies on the\n",
      "surface of the ground, exposed to alternate dryness and moisture, and\n",
      "lose its power of germination. Only those nuts which are buried under\n",
      "the surface are in a condition to germinate. Many a hickory has grown\n",
      "from a nut deposited in the burrow of a squirrel; and it is not an\n",

      "to say that no single species of the animal creation may not be\n",
      "destroyed without derangement of the method of nature; for thousands\n",
      "have, in the course of time, become extinct by the spontaneous action of\n",

      "a vista of overarching trees, and redolent always with the peculiar\n",

      "once the tenants of an ancient garden. The sight of this tree always\n",
      "affected me with sadness mingled with a sensation of grandeur. This old\n",
      "solitary standard, with a few rose-bushes and lilacs beneath its\n",
      "umbrage, was all that remained on the premises of an old mansion-house\n",
      "which had long ago disappeared from its enclosure. Thus the Weeping\n",
      "Willow became associated in my memory, not with the graveyard or the\n",
      "pleasure-ground, but with these domestic ruins, the sites of old\n",
      "homesteads whose grounds had partially reverted to their primitive state\n",
      "of wildness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of all the drooping trees the Weeping Willow is the most remarkable,\n",
      "from the perfect pendulous character of its spray. It is also\n",
      "consecrated to the Muse by the part which has been assigned to it in\n",
      "many a scene of romance, and by its connection with pathetic incidents\n",
      "recorded in Holy Writ. It is invested with a moral interest by its\n",
      "symbolical representation of sorrow, in the drooping of its terminal\n",
      "spray, by its fanciful use as a garland for disappointed lovers, and by\n",
      "the employment of it in burial-grounds and in funereal paintings. We\n",
      "remember it in sacred history, associating it with the rivers of Babylon\n",
      "and with the tears of the children of Israel, who sat down under the\n",
      "shade of this tree and hung their harps upon its branches. It is\n",
      "distinguished by the graceful beauty of its outlines, its light green\n",
      "delicate foliage, its sorrowing attitude, and its flowing drapery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence the Weeping Willow never fails to please the sight even of the\n",
      "most insensible observer. Whether we see it waving its long branches\n",

      "romance to bind us more closely to nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not easy to imagine anything of this character more beautiful than\n",

      "comparable with it in this respect. The American elm displays a more\n",
      "graceful bend of all the branches that form its hemispherical head; and\n",
      "there are several weeping birches which are very picturesque when\n",

      "\n",
      "It is probable that the drooping trees acquired the name of â€œweeping,â€\n",
      "by assuming the attitude of a person in tears, who bends over and seems\n",
      "to droop. This is the general attitude of affliction in allegorical\n",
      "representations. But this habit is far from giving them a melancholy\n",

      "autumn. In the opening of the year many inconspicuous plants are brought\n",
      "suddenly into notice by their lively contrast with the dark and faded\n",
      "complexion of the ground. The mosses, lichens, and liverworts perform,\n",
      "therefore, an important part in the limning of the vernal landscape. On\n",

      "are covered with these plants, are brighter than the turf that surrounds\n",
      "them, with its seared grasses and herbage. They display circles of\n",
      "painted lichens, varying from an olive-gray to red and yellow, and tufts\n",
      "of green mosses which surpass the fairest artificial lawn in the\n",
      "perfection of their verdure. Many of the flowerless plants are\n",

      "little twig becomes brightened on the surface, as if it had been glossed\n",
      "by art. The swelling of the bark occasioned by the flow of sap gives the\n",
      "whole mass a livelier hue. This appearance is very evident in the\n",
      "peach-tree, in willows and poplars, in the snowy mespilus, and in all\n",
      "trees with a long and slender spray. Hence the ashen green of the\n",
      "poplar, the golden green of the willow, and the dark crimson of the\n",
      "peach-tree, the wild rose, and the red osier, are perceptibly heightened\n",
      "by the first warm days of spring. Nor is this illumination confined to\n",

      "the cherry, the birch, and the lime, are dimly flushed with the hue of\n",
      "reviving life. As many of the forest trees display their principal\n",

      "colored dots, produce in the aggregate a great amount of color. This is\n",
      "apparent in all trees as soon as they are affected by the warmth of the\n",
      "season. But as vegetation comes forward, the flower-buds grow brighter\n",
      "and brighter, till they are fully expanded, some in the form of fringes,\n",
      "as in most of our forest trees, others, as in our orchard trees, in\n",

      "colored, but containing a great variety of pale shades, that hangs from\n",
      "the oak, the birch, the willow, the alder, and the poplar, is sufficient\n",

      "their autumnal dress, forming a yellow shade of green. The tender leaves\n",
      "of the maple and of the different oaks are all greenish purple of\n",
      "different shades. On the other hand, the foliage of trees that do not\n",
      "change their color in the autumn displays only a diluted shade of green,\n",
      "in its half-unfolded state. This remark, however, is not universal in\n",
      "its application; for we see the lilac, that appears in autumn without\n",

      "a cinereous purple, mingled with an olivegreen. The flowers of the elm,\n",
      "of a dark maroon, and the crimson flowers of the red maple, coming\n",
      "before their leaves, are an important element in the earliest hues of\n",
      "the wood. The red maple, especially, which is the principal timber of\n",
      "the swamps in all the southern parts of New England, yields a warm and\n",
      "ruddy glow to the woods in spring, hardly less to be admired than its\n",

      "stateliness and beauty of such a tree an emblem of the noble virtues of\n",

      "beauty of repose. The opposite effect is observed in works of\n",
      "architecture, in which irregularity puzzles the mind to discover the\n",
      "mutual relations of parts, and becomes disagreeable by disturbing our\n",

      "its long branches in a crooked and horizontal direction over this\n",
      "emerald pool. It became the wonder of all that the tree should adopt\n",
      "such an eccentricity of habit, hardly showing a single branch on the\n",
      "land side, and bending over the water like an angler sitting at his\n",
      "task. It was evident that it had never been trimmed into this shape by\n",

      "were hanged upon it had caused all the branches to wither and fall on\n",

      "picturesque object in landscape. Indeed, there is no other tree, not\n",
      "excepting the oak, that will compare with it in certain eccentricities\n",

      "top. More frequently the Tupelo displays no symmetry of any kind,\n",
      "extending its branches mostly on one side, and often putting forth two\n",
      "or three branches greatly beyond all the others. Many of these are\n",
      "considerably twisted, inclining downward from a horizontal position, not\n",
      "with a curve like those of the elm, but straight, like those of the\n",

      "It does not exhibit the sturdy ruggedness of the oak; it is not so\n",
      "evidently defiant of wind and tempest. It seems, indeed, to make no\n",
      "outward pretensions of strength. It bends to the breeze which the oak\n",
      "defies, and is more seldom, therefore, broken by the wind. The Elm is\n",
      "especially the wayside tree of New England, and it forms the most\n",
      "remarkable feature of our domestic landscape. If there be in any other\n",
      "section of our land as many, they are individuals mingled with the\n",
      "forest, and are not so frequent by the roadsides. In this part of the\n",
      "country the Elm has been planted and cherished from the earliest period\n",
      "of our history, and the inhabitants have always looked upon it with\n",
      "admiration, and valued it as a landscape ornament above every other\n",
      "species. It is the most drooping of the drooping trees, except the\n",
      "willow, which it surpasses in grandeur and in the variety of its forms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though the Elm has never been consecrated by the muse of classic song,\n",
      "or dignified by making a figure in the paintings of the old masters, the\n",
      "native inhabitant of New England associates the varied forms of this\n",
      "tree with all that is delightful in the scenery or memorable in the\n",
      "history of our land. All spacious avenues are bordered with elms, and\n",
      "their magnificent rows are everywhere familiar to his sight. He has seen\n",
      "them extending their broad and benevolent arms over many a hospitable\n",
      "mansion and many a humble cottage, and equally harmonizing with all.\n",
      "They meet his sight in the public grounds of the city with their ample\n",
      "shade and flowing spray; and he beholds them in the clearing, where they\n",
      "were left by the woodman to stand as solitary landmarks of the\n",
      "devastated space. Every year of his life he has seen the beautiful\n",
      "hangbird weave his pensile nest upon the long and flexible branches,\n",
      "secure from the reach of every foe. From its vast dome of branches and\n",
      "foliage he has listened to the songs of the late and early birds, and\n",
      "under its canopy he has witnessed many a scene of rustic amusement.\n",
      "\n",
      "To a native of New England, therefore, the Elm has a character more\n",
      "nearly approaching that of sacredness than any other tree. Setting aside\n",
      "the pleasure derived from it as an object of material beauty, it reminds\n",
      "him of the familiar scenes of home and the events of his early life. How\n",
      "many a happy assemblage of children and young persons has been gathered\n",
      "under its shade in the sultry noons of summer! How many a young May\n",
      "queen has been crowned under its tasselled roof, when the greensward was\n",

      "weary traveller rested from his journey under its wide-spreading boughs,\n",
      "and from a state of weariness and vexation, when oâ€™erspent by heat and\n",
      "length of way, subsided into quiet thankfulness and content!\n",
      "\n",
      "In my own mind the Elm is intimately allied with those old\n",
      "dwelling-houses which were built in the early part of the last century,\n",
      "and form one of the principal remaining features of New England home\n",
      "architecture during that period. They are known by their broad and ample\n",
      "but low-studded rooms, their two stories in front, their numerous\n",
      "windows with small panes, their single chimney in the centre of the\n",
      "roof, that sloped down to one story in the rear, and their general\n",
      "homely appearance, reminding us of the simplicity of life that\n",
      "characterized our people before the Revolution. Their very homeliness is\n",
      "attractive, by leaving the imagination free to dwell upon their\n",
      "interesting suggestions. Not many of these venerable houses are now\n",
      "extant; but whenever we see one, it is almost invariably accompanied by\n",
      "its Elm, standing upon the green open space that slopes down from it in\n",
      "front, waving its long branches in melancholy grandeur above the old\n",
      "homestead, and drooping, as with sorrow, over the infirmities of its old\n",
      "companion of a century.\n",
      "\n",
      "Early in April the Elm puts forth its flowers, of a dark maroon color,\n",
      "in numerous clusters, fringing the long terminal spray, and filling up\n",
      "the whole space so effectually that the branches can hardly be seen;\n",
      "they appear at the same time with the crimson flowers of the red maple,\n",
      "and give the tree a very sombre appearance. The seeds ripen early, and\n",
      "being small and chaffy are wafted in all directions and carried to great\n",
      "distances by the wind. In the early part of June, soon after the leaves\n",
      "are expanded, the Elm displays the most beauty. At this time only can\n",
      "its verdure be considered brilliant: for the leaf soon fades to a dull\n",
      "green, and displays no tints, except that of a rusty yellow in the\n",
      "autumn. In perfectly healthy elms, standing on a deep soil, the\n",
      "brightness of the foliage is retained to a later period; but the trees\n",
      "near Boston have suffered so much from the ravages of the cankerworm\n",
      "that their health is injured, and their want of vitality is shown by the\n",
      "premature fading and dropping of their foliage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing can exceed the American Elm in a certain harmonious combination\n",
      "of sturdiness and grace,â€”two qualities which are seldom united. Along\n",
      "with its superior magnitude, we observe a great length and slenderness\n",
      "of its branches, without anything in the combination that indicates\n",
      "weakness. It is very agreeable to witness the union, under any\n",
      "circumstances, of two interesting or admirable traits of character which\n",
      "are supposed to be incompatible. Hence the complacency we feel when we\n",
      "meet a brave man who is amiable and polite, or a learned man who is\n",
      "neither reserved nor pedantic. A slender vine, supported by a sturdy\n",
      "tree, forms a very agreeable image; not less delightful is that\n",
      "consonance we perceive in a majestic Elm, formed by the union of\n",
      "grandeur with the gracefulness of its own flowing drapery.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Elm is generally subdivided into several equal branches, diverging\n",
      "from a common centre at a small distance above the ground. The height of\n",
      "this divergence depends on the condition of the tree when it was a\n",
      "seedling, whether it grew in a forest or in an open field; and the angle\n",
      "made by these branches is much wider when it obtained its growth in an\n",
      "isolated situation. The shape of different elms varies more than that of\n",
      "any other known species. It is indeed almost the only tree which may be\n",
      "said to exhibit more than one normal figure, setting aside those\n",
      "variations of form which are the natural effects of youth and age. The\n",
      "American Elm never displays one central shaft to which the branches are\n",
      "subordinate, like the English Elm; or rather, I should say, that when it\n",
      "has only a single shaft it is without any limbs, and is surrounded only\n",
      "with short and slender twigs. This leads me to speak of its normal\n",

      "from the time it was a seedling until it attains its full stature in an\n",
      "open space. It then shows a broad hemispherical head, formed by branches\n",
      "of nearly equal size, issuing chiefly from a common centre, diverging\n",
      "first at a small angle, and gradually spreading outward with a curve\n",
      "that may be traced throughout their length. A considerable number of our\n",

      "One of the most admirable of these different forms is that of the vase.\n",
      "The base is represented by the roots of the tree as they project above\n",
      "the ground, making a sort of pedestal for the trunk. The neck of the\n",
      "vase is the trunk before it is subdivided. The middle of the vase\n",
      "consists of the lower part of the branches as they swell outwards with a\n",
      "graceful curve, then gradually diverge, until they bend over at their\n",
      "extremities and form the lip of the vase by a circle of terminal spray.\n",
      "Perfect specimens of this beautiful form are rare, but in a row or a\n",

      "the general admiration of this tree, that great numbers of them are left\n",
      "in clearings in all parts of the country. The State of Maine abounds in\n",
      "trees of this form, sending forth almost perpendicularly a number of\n",
      "branches, that spread out rather suddenly at a considerable height, in\n",
      "the shape of an umbrella. Trees of this type have much of that grandeur\n",
      "which is caused by great height and small dimensions, as observed in a\n",
      "palm-tree. A remarkable trait in the character of the Elm is, that,\n",
      "unlike other trees, it seldom loses its beauty, and is often improved in\n",
      "shape, by growing while young in a dense assemblage. It is simply\n",
      "modified into a more slender shape, usually subdivided very near the\n",
      "ground into several branches that diverge but little until they reach\n",
      "the summit of the wood. Other trees, when they have grown in a dense\n",

      "regarded as of a normal character, is the plume, caused by some peculiar\n",
      "conditions attending its early growth. The shaft is sometimes double,\n",
      "but usually not divided at all, except into two or three small branches\n",
      "at its very summit. It is perpendicular to near three fourths of its\n",
      "height, and then bends over, like one of the outer branches of a\n",

      "from the ground to its summit with a dense embroidery of vine-like twigs\n",
      "that cluster round it in all ways, often inverted, as if it were covered\n",
      "with a woody vine. The cause of this form seems to be the removal of the\n",
      "tree into an uncongenial soil, that is too scanty and innutritious to\n",

      "about ten acres, surrounded by a narrow stream that was fed by a steep\n",
      "ridge forming a sort of amphitheatre round more than half its\n",
      "circumference. The ridge was a declivity of near a hundred feet in\n",
      "height, and so steep that you could climb it only by taking hold of the\n",
      "trees and bushes that covered it. The whole surface consisted of a thin\n",
      "stratum of soil deposited upon a slaty rock; but the growth of trees\n",
      "upon this slope was beautiful and immense, and the water that was\n",
      "constantly trickling from a thousand fountains kept the ground all the\n",
      "year green with mosses and ferns, and gay with many varieties of\n",
      "flowers. The soil was so rich in the meadow enclosed by this ridge, and\n",
      "annually fertilized by the _dÃ©bris_ washed from the hills, that the\n",
      "proprietor every summer filled his barns with hay, which was obtained\n",
      "from it without any cultivation.\n",
      "\n",
      "I revisited this spot a few years since, after a long period of absence.\n",
      "A new owner, â€œa man of progress and enterprise,â€ had felled the trees\n",
      "that grew so beautifully on the steep sides of this elevation, and\n",
      "valley and hill have become a dreary and unprofitable waste. The thin\n",
      "soil that sustained the forest, no longer protected by the trees and\n",
      "their undergrowth, has been washed down into the valley, leaving nothing\n",
      "but a bald, rocky surface, whose hideousness is scarcely relieved by a\n",
      "few straggling vines. The valley is also ruined; for the inundations to\n",
      "which it is subject after any copious rain destroy every crop that is\n",
      "planted upon it, and render it impracticable for tillage. It is covered\n",
      "with sand heaps; the little stream that glided round it, fringed with\n",
      "azaleas and wild roses, has disappeared, and the land is reduced to a\n",
      "barren pasture.\n",
      "\n",
      "The general practice of the pioneers of civilization on this continent\n",
      "was to cut down the wood chiefly from the uplands and the lower slopes\n",
      "of the hills and mountains. They cleared those tracts which were most\n",
      "valuable for immediate use and cultivation. Necessity led them to pursue\n",
      "the very course required by the laws of nature for improving the soil\n",
      "and climate. The first clearings were made chiefly for purposes of\n",
      "agriculture; and as every farm was surrounded by a rampart of woods, it\n",
      "was sheltered from the force of the winds and pleasantly open to the\n",
      "sun. But when men began to fell the woods to supply the demands of towns\n",
      "and cities for fuel and lumber, these clearings were gradually deprived\n",
      "of their shelter, by levelling the surrounding forest and opening the\n",
      "country to the winds from every quarter. But the clearing of the wood\n",
      "from the plains, while it has rendered the climate more unstable, has\n",
      "not been the cause of inundations or the diminution of streams. This\n",
      "evil has been produced by clearing the mountains and lesser elevations\n",
      "having steep or rocky sides; and if this destructive work is not checked\n",
      "by legislation or by the wisdom of the people, plains and valleys now\n",
      "green and fertile will become profitless for tillage or pasture, and the\n",
      "advantages we shall have sacrificed will be irretrievable in the\n",
      "lifetime of a single generation. The same indiscriminate felling of\n",
      "woods has rendered many a once fertile region in Europe barren and\n",
      "uninhabitable, equally among the cold mountains of Norway and the sunny\n",
      "plains of Brittany.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our climate suffers more than formerly from summer droughts. Many\n",
      "ancient streams have entirely disappeared, and a still greater number\n",
      "are dry in summer. Boussingault mentions a fact that clearly illustrates\n",
      "the condition to which we may be exposed in thousands of locations on\n",
      "this continent. In the island of Ascension there was a beautiful spring,\n",
      "situated at the foot of a mountain which was covered with wood. By\n",
      "degrees the spring became less copious, and at length failed. While its\n",
      "waters were annually diminishing in bulk, the mountain had been\n",
      "gradually cleared of its forest. The disappearance of the spring was\n",
      "attributed to the clearing. The mountain was again planted, and as the\n",
      "new growth of wood increased, the spring reappeared, and finally\n",
      "attained its original fulness. More to be dreaded than drought, and\n",
      "produced by the same cause,â€”the clearing of steep declivities of their\n",
      "wood,â€”are the excessive inundations to which all parts of the country\n",
      "are subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "If it were in the power of man to dispose his woods and tillage in the\n",
      "most advantageous manner, he might not only produce an important\n",
      "amelioration of the general climate, but he might diminish the frequency\n",
      "and severity both of droughts and inundations, and preserve the general\n",
      "fulness of streams. If every man were to pursue that course which would\n",
      "protect his own grounds from these evils, it would be sufficient to\n",
      "bring about this beneficent result. If each owner of land would keep all\n",
      "his hills and declivities, and all slopes that contain only a thin\n",
      "deposit of soil or a quarry, covered with forest, he would lessen his\n",
      "local inundations from vernal thaws and summer rains. Such a covering of\n",
      "wood tends to equalize the moisture that is distributed over the land,\n",
      "causing it, when showered upon the hills, to be retained by the\n",
      "mechanical action of the trees and their undergrowth of shrubs and\n",
      "herbaceous plants, and by the spongy surface of the soil underneath\n",
      "them, made porous by mosses, decayed leaves, and other _dÃ©bris_, so that\n",
      "the plains and valleys have a moderate oozing supply of moisture for a\n",
      "long time after every shower. Without this covering, the water when\n",
      "precipitated upon the slopes, would immediately rush down over an\n",
      "unprotected surface in torrents upon the space below.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every one has witnessed the effects of clearing the woods and other\n",
      "vegetation from moderate declivities in his own neighborhood. He has\n",
      "observed how rapidly a valley is inundated by heavy showers, if the\n",
      "rising grounds that form its basin are bare of trees and planted with\n",
      "the farmerâ€™s crops. Even grass alone serves to check the rapidity with\n",
      "which the water finds its way to the bottom of the slope. Let it be\n",
      "covered with bushes and vines, and the water flows with a speed still\n",
      "more diminished. Let this shrubbery grow into a forest, and the valley\n",
      "would never be inundated except by a long-continued and flooding rain.\n",
      "Woods and their undergrowth are indeed the only barriers against\n",
      "frequent and sudden inundations, and the only means in the economy of\n",
      "nature for preserving an equal fulness of streams during all seasons of\n",
      "the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first thought, it may seem strange that the clearing of forests\n",
      "should be equally the cause both of drought and inundations; but these\n",
      "apparently incompatible facts are easily explained by considering the\n",
      "different effects produced by woods standing in different situations. An\n",
      "excess of moisture in the valleys comes from the drainage of the hills,\n",
      "and the same conditions that will cause them to be dried up at certain\n",
      "times will cause them to be flooded at others. Natureâ€™s design seems to\n",
      "be to preserve a constant moderate fulness of streams and standing\n",
      "water. This purpose she accomplishes by clothing the general surface of\n",
      "the country with wood. When man disturbs this arrangement, he may\n",
      "produce evil consequences which he had never anticipated. We are not,\n",
      "however, to conclude that we may not improve the soil and climate by\n",

      "without formality. When covered with leaves, it bears some resemblance\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "While Nature, in the forms of trees, in the color of their foliage and\n",
      "the gracefulness of their spray, has displayed a great variety of\n",
      "outline and tinting, and provided a constant entertainment for the\n",
      "sight, she has increased their attractions by endowing them with a\n",
      "different susceptibility to motion from the action of the winds. In\n",
      "their motions we perceive no less variety than in their forms. The\n",
      "different species differ like animals; some being graceful and easy,\n",
      "others stiff and awkward; some calm and intrepid, others nervous and\n",
      "easily agitated. Perhaps with stricter analogy we might compare them to\n",
      "human beings; for we find trees that represent the man of quiet and\n",
      "dignified deportment, also the man of excited manners and rapid\n",
      "gesticulations. Some trees, like the fir, having stiff branches and\n",
      "foliage, move awkwardly backward and forward in the wind, without any\n",
      "separate motions of their leaves. While we admire the symmetrical and\n",
      "stately forms of such trees, we are reminded of men who present a noble\n",
      "personal appearance, accompanied with ungainly manners.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some trees, having stiff branches with flexible leaves, do not bend to a\n",
      "moderate breeze, but their foliage readily yields to the motion of the\n",
      "wind. This habit is observed in the oak and the ash, in all trees that\n",
      "have a pendulous foliage and upright or horizontal branches. The poplars\n",
      "possess this habit in a remarkable degree, and it is proverbial in the\n",
      "aspen. It is also conspicuous in the common pear-tree and in the small\n",
      "white birch. Other trees, like the American elm, wave their branches\n",
      "gracefully, with but little apparent motion of their leaves. We observe\n",
      "the same habit in the weeping willow, and indeed in all trees with a\n",
      "long and flexible spray. The wind produces by its action on these a\n",
      "general sweeping movement without any rustle. It is easy to observe,\n",
      "when walking in a grove, that the only graceful motions come from trees\n",
      "with drooping branches, because these alone are long and slender.\n",
      "\n",
      "The very rapid motion of the leaves of the aspen has given origin to\n",
      "some remarkable superstitions. The Highlanders of Scotland believe the\n",
      "wood of this tree to be that of which the holy cross was made, and that\n",
      "its leaves are consequently never allowed to rest. Impressed with the\n",
      "awfulness of the tragedy of the crucifixion, they are constantly\n",
      "indicating to the winds the terrors that agitate them. The small white\n",
      "birch displays considerable of the same motion of the leaves; but we\n",
      "take little notice of it, because they are softer and produce less of a\n",
      "rustling sound. The flickering lights and shadows observed when walking\n",
      "under these trees, on a bright noonday, have always been admired. All\n",
      "these habits awaken our interest in trees and other plants by\n",
      "assimilating them to animated things.\n",
      "\n",
      "Much of the beauty of the silver poplar comes from its glittering\n",
      "lights, when it presents the green upper surface of its foliage,\n",
      "alternating rapidly with the white silvery surface beneath. This we may\n",
      "readily perceive even in cloudy weather, but in the bright sunshine the\n",
      "contrasts are very brilliant. In all trees, however, we observe this\n",
      "glittering beauty of motion in the sunshine. The under part of leaves\n",
      "being less glossy than the upper part, there is in the assemblage the\n",
      "same tremulous lustre that appears on the rippled surface of a lake by\n",
      "moonlight.\n",
      "\n",
      "We observe occasionally other motions which I have not described, such\n",
      "as the uniform bending of the whole tree. In a strong current of wind,\n",
      "tall and slender trees especially attract our attention by bending over\n",
      "uniformly like a plume. This habit is often seen in the white birch, a\n",
      "tree that in its usual assemblages takes a plumelike form. When a whole\n",
      "grove of white birches is seen thus bending over in one direction from\n",
      "the action of a brisk wind, they seem like a procession of living forms.\n",
      "In a storm we watch with peculiar interest the bending forms of certain\n",
      "tall elms, such as we often see in clearings, with their heads bowed\n",
      "down almost to the ground by the force of the tempest. It is only the\n",
      "waves of the ocean and the tossing of its billows that can afford us so\n",
      "vivid an impression of the sublimity of a tempest as the violent swaying\n",
      "of a forest and the roaring of the winds among the lofty tree-tops.\n",
      "\n",
      "The motions of an assemblage of trees cannot be observed except from a\n",
      "stand that permits us to look down upon the surface formed by their\n",
      "summits. We should then perceive that pines and firs, with all the\n",
      "stiffness of their branches, display a great deal of undulating motion.\n",
      "These undulations or wavy movements are particularly graceful in a grove\n",
      "of hemlocks, when they are densely assembled without being crowded. It\n",
      "is remarkable that one of the most graceful of trees belongs to a family\n",
      "which are distinguished by their stiffness and formality. The hemlock,\n",
      "unlike other firs and spruces, has a very flexible spray, with leaves\n",
      "also slightly movable, which are constantly sparkling when agitated by\n",
      "the wind. If we look down from an opposite point, considerably elevated,\n",
      "upon a grove of hemlocks when they are exposed to brisk currents of\n",
      "wind, they display a peculiar undulating movement of the branches and\n",
      "foliage, made more apparent by the glitter of their leaves.\n",
      "\n",
      "The surface of any assemblage of trees when in motion bears a close\n",
      "resemblance to the waves of the sea. But hemlocks represent its\n",
      "undulations when greatly agitated, without any broken lines upon its\n",
      "surface. Other firs display in their motions harsher angles and a\n",
      "somewhat broken surface of the waves. We see the tops of these trees and\n",
      "their extreme branches awkwardly swaying backwards and forwards, and\n",
      "forming a surface like that of the sea when it is broken by tumultuous\n",
      "waves of a moderate height. The one suggests the idea of tumult and\n",

      "that plants growing in an aquarium keep the water supplied with\n",
      "atmospheric airâ€”not with simple oxygen, but with oxygen chemically\n",
      "combined with nitrogenâ€”by some vital process that takes place in the\n",
      "leaves of plants. As the lungs of animals decompose the air which they\n",
      "inspire, and breathe out carbonic-acid gas, plants in their turn\n",
      "decompose this deleterious gas, and breathe out pure atmospheric air.\n",
      "His theory is that the atmosphere is entirely the product of vegetation,\n",
      "and that nature has no other means of composing it; that it is not\n",
      "simply a chemical, but a vital product; and that its production, like\n",

      "The use of the foliage of trees in renovating the atmosphere is not, I\n",
      "believe, denied by any man of science. This theory has been proved to be\n",
      "true by experiments in vital chemistry. The same chemical appropriation\n",
      "of gases and transpiration of oxygen is performed by all classes of\n",
      "vegetables; but any work in the economy of nature assigned to vegetation\n",
      "is the most effectually accomplished by trees. The property of foliage\n",
      "that requires carbonic-acid gas for its breathing purposes, and causes\n",
      "it to give out oxygen, is of vital importance; and it is hardly to be\n",
      "doubted that a close room well lighted by the sun would sustain its\n",
      "healthful atmosphere a longer time, if it were filled with plants in\n",
      "leaf, but not in flower, and occupied by breathing animals, than if the\n",
      "animals occupied it without the plants.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there is another function performed by the foliage of trees and\n",
      "herbs in which no chemical process is involved,â€”that of exhaling\n",
      "moisture into the atmosphere after it has been absorbed by the roots.\n",
      "Hence the humidity of this element is greatly dependent on foliage. A\n",
      "few simple experiments will show how much more rapidly and abundantly\n",
      "this evaporation takes place when the soil is covered with growing\n",
      "plants than when the surface is bare. Take two teacups of equal size and\n",
      "fill them with water. Place them on a table, and insert into one of them\n",
      "cuttings of growing plants with their leaves, and let the other stand\n",
      "with water only. In a few hours the water will disappear from the cup\n",
      "containing the plants, while that in the other cup will not be sensibly\n",
      "diminished. Indeed, there is reason to believe that gallons of water\n",
      "might be evaporated into the air by keeping the cup containing the\n",
      "cuttings always full, before the single gill contained in the other cup\n",
      "would disappear. If a few cuttings will evaporate a half-pint of water\n",
      "in twelve hours, we can imagine the vast quantity constantly exhaled\n",
      "into the atmosphere by a single tree. The largest steam-boiler in use,\n",
      "kept constantly boiling, would not probably evaporate more water than\n",
      "one large elm in the same time.\n",
      "\n",
      "We may judge, from our experiment with the cuttings, that a vastly\n",
      "greater proportion of moisture would be exhaled into the atmosphere from\n",
      "any given surface of ground when covered with vegetation, than from the\n",
      "same amount of uncovered surface, or even of standing water. Plants are\n",
      "indeed the most important existing agents of nature for conveying the\n",
      "moisture of the earth into the air. The quantity of transpiring foliage\n",
      "from a dense assemblage of trees must be immense. The evaporation of\n",
      "water from the vast ocean itself is probably small compared with that\n",

      "the water evaporated from the ocean would not produce rain enough to\n",
      "sustain vegetation, if by any accident every continent and island were\n",
      "deprived of its trees. The whole earth would soon become a desert. I\n",

      "The flowering of the forest is the conclusion of the beautiful phenomena\n",

      "viewed in this manner, and all the tiresome uniformity of summer verdure\n",

      "The Oak surpasses all other trees, not only in actual strength, but also\n",
      "in that outward appearance by which this quality is manifested. This\n",
      "expression is owing to the general horizontal tendency of its principal\n",
      "boughs, the great angularity of the unions of its smaller branches, the\n",
      "want of flexibility in its spray, and its great size compared with its\n",
      "height, all manifesting power to resist the wind and the storm. Hence it\n",
      "is called the monarch of trees, surpassing all in the qualities of\n",
      "nobleness and capacity. It is the embodiment of strength, dignity, and\n",
      "grandeur. The severest hurricane cannot overthrow it, and, by destroying\n",
      "some of its principal branches, leaves it only with more wonderful proof\n",
      "of its resistance. Like a rock in mid-ocean, it becomes in old age a\n",
      "just symbol of fortitude, parting with its limbs one by one, as they are\n",
      "withered by decay or broken by the gale, but still retaining its\n",
      "many-centuried existence, when, like an old patriarch, it has seen all\n",

      "\n",
      "A remarkable habit of the Oak is that of putting forth its lower\n",
      "branches at a wide angle from the central shaft, which rapidly\n",
      "diminishes in size, but does not entirely disappear above the lower\n",
      "junction. No other tree displays more irregularities in its\n",
      "ramification. The beauty of its spray depends on a certain crinkling of\n",
      "the small branches; yet the Oak, which, on account of these\n",
      "angularities, is especially adapted to rude situations, is equally\n",
      "attractive in an open cultivated plain. It forms a singularly noble and\n",
      "majestic standard; and though surpassed by the elm in grace, beauty, and\n",

      "when only half developed, having a silvery lustre, intershaded with\n",
      "purple, crimson, and lilac. The leaves, when fully expanded in all the\n",
      "typical oaks, are deeply scalloped in a way which is peculiar to this\n",
      "genus of trees; their verdure is of more than ordinary purity; they are\n",
      "of a firm texture, and glossy upon their upper surface, like evergreen\n",

      "its perpendicular growth, having an obstinate inclination to spread. It\n",
      "has also a more abundant undergrowth than many other woods, because it\n",
      "sends its roots downward into the soil, instead of monopolizing the\n",

      "natural groups of trees to please the eye with their spontaneous beauty.\n",
      "They surround the clearing with palisades of naked pillars, unrelieved\n",

      "objects, than that of any other part of the country. At the South, where\n",
      "agriculture is carried on in large plantations, we see spacious fields\n",
      "of tillage, and forest groups of corresponding size. But the small,\n",
      "independent farming of New England has produced a charming variety of\n",
      "wood, pasture, and tillage, so agreeably intermixed that we are never\n",
      "weary of looking upon it. The varied surface of the land has increased\n",

      "general stillness of the winds. The voices of solitary birds, and other\n",
      "sounds peculiar to the woods, exalt this impression. Indeed, the\n",
      "grandeur and solemnity of a magnificent wood are hardly surpassed by\n",
      "anything else in nature. A very slight sound, during a calm, in one of\n",
      "these deep woods, has a distinctness almost startling, like the ticking\n",

      "sense of the magnitude of the place, and of its deep solemnity, than\n",
      "louder sounds, which are attended with a confused reverberation. The\n",

      "developed, having room enough to expand to their normal proportions. We\n",
      "often see their shadows cast separately upon the ground, which is green\n",
      "beneath them as in an orchard. If we look upon this assemblage from an\n",
      "adjoining eminence, we observe a variety of outlines by which we may\n",

      "as a picturesque and beautiful feature of landscape. The painter finds\n",
      "in these spontaneous collections of wood an endless variety of grouping\n",
      "and outline for the exercise of his art; and the botanist discovers, in\n",
      "their glens and hollows, hundreds of species that would perish in an\n",

      "fir and beech woods, by a deficiency of undergrowth, and this differs in\n",
      "botanical characters as well as in quantity, according to the\n",

      "point of junction, like the elm. Others send up their trunk nearly\n",
      "straight to the very summit of the tree, giving out lateral branches\n",
      "from all points almost horizontally. There is a third form that seems to\n",
      "have no central shaft, because it is so greatly contorted that it can\n",
      "only be traced among its subordinate branches by the most careful\n",

      "lightning is very ancient. It probably originated in some religious\n",
      "ideas of their sanctity, and men in more enlightened times have\n",
      "endeavored to explain it by philosophy, instead of rejecting it as\n",
      "fable. It was affirmed by Hugh Maxwell, an American writer, that\n",
      "lightning often strikes the elm, the chestnut, the oak, the pine, and\n",
      "less frequently the ash; but it always evades the beech, the birch, and\n",
      "the maple. Captain Dibdin remarks, in a letter to Alexander Wilson, that\n",
      "in the forests of Virginia the pines, though taller than the oaks, were\n",
      "less frequently injured by lightning, and considers them pretty secure\n",
      "when growing among oaks. These accounts by different writers are too\n",
      "various and contradictory to be of much value in aiding us to discover\n",
      "the truth. It is probable that the partial exemption of certain trees\n",
      "from the stroke of lightning, if any such accounts be true, depends on\n",
      "their size and shape. A tall tree in an assemblage would be more exposed\n",
      "than the others. It may also be supposed that if a tree has a regular\n",
      "ramification, smooth and straight branches and trunk, it is better\n",
      "formed for a conductor, and that it would be more liable to receive a\n",
      "charge of the fluid. But all these opinions are probably of the same\n",
      "character with those respecting the antipathy of serpents for certain\n",
      "trees,â€”traditionary notions which are hardly worthy of investigation.\n",
      "The opinion of the ancients concerning the immunity of the laurel was\n",
      "probably derived from their idea of its sanctity as the tree which was\n",
      "dedicated to Apollo. At the present day there exists in Italy a similar\n",
      "notion concerning the white grapevine. Some of the peasantry of that\n",
      "country are accustomed to twining its branches around the head and waist\n",
      "as a protection from a thunder-stroke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trees are generally believed to protect a house adjoining them from\n",
      "lightning; on the contrary, it is known that men and animals seeking\n",
      "refuge under a tree in an open plain are in greater danger than outside\n",
      "of it. The lightning is therefore probably conducted by the water\n",
      "passing down on the surface of the branches and trunk; for if the tree\n",
      "itself were the conductor, the lightning would pass through the trunk\n",
      "into the ground, and, like a lightning-rod, act as a protection to\n",
      "objects near, but not in contact with it. Dr. Franklin thought the\n",
      "safest place a few yards distant from a tree, and a little outside of\n",
      "its widest spread. It is unsafe to stand under the drip of a tree, which\n",
      "might convey to the person an electric charge. It was the opinion of M.\n",
      "Arago, that trees overtopping houses at small distances cannot be\n",
      "regarded as affording sure protection, like a properly adjusted\n",
      "lightning-rod; but he admitted that when a storm passes over a forest it\n",
      "is decidedly enfeebled. The forest certainly diminishes the power of a\n",
      "thunderbolt. The security derived from trees attaches principally to\n",
      "large assemblages. Though a house may receive but little protection from\n",

      "of its predominance in any tract that is occupied by it, and the close\n",
      "matting of leaves that covers the ground under a beechen wood prevents\n",
      "any abundance of undergrowth. The same inconvenient habit is the cause\n",
      "of its rareness in dressed grounds. George Barnard says of the English\n",
      "Beech: â€œIn no tree are the decaying hues of autumn more beautiful than\n",
      "in the Golden Beech, its foliage changing from green to the brightest\n",
      "orange, then to glowing red, and eventually to a russet brown, in which\n",
      "state the leaves remain on the tree through the winter.â€ The leaf of the\n",

      "The style and spray of the Beech, as observed in its denuded state, are\n",

      "when they start from the tree, but soon make a curvature by turning\n",
      "regularly upwards, and causing a peculiar primness in their general\n",
      "appearance. Every small twig also turns upwards, pointed with elongated\n",
      "leaf-buds, resembling so many little spears. The terminal branches,\n",
      "forming the spray, are very numerous and slender, and remarkably\n",
      "beautiful. The Beech, when in full leaf, is seen to the best advantage\n",
      "where it skirts the edge of a wood, if it has grown up there since the\n",
      "original clearing. In that situation we perceive the elegant sweep of\n",
      "its branches, and the upright character of its leaves, each leaf\n",
      "pointing obliquely upwards in the direction of the spray, instead of\n",
      "hanging loosely in all ways, like the foliage of the large-leaved\n",
      "poplars. Deciduous trees have generally a drooping foliage, and the want\n",
      "of this habit in the Beech gives it a very lively appearance. The\n",
      "heaviness attributed by Gilpin to the English tree is not observed in\n",

      "darker color and firmer texture. The aments of the Hickory are in\n",

      "The Hickory rises to a greater proportional height, with less length and\n",
      "spread of the branches, the lower ones being higher from the root of the\n",
      "tree and smaller than those of the walnut. Many of the trees are\n",
      "flattened at the top, and take a cylindrical form, when they approach to\n",

      "displaying frequent gaps, and presenting several distinct masses of\n",
      "foliage.\n",

      "The Hickory, therefore, when full-grown, has seldom much elegance, and\n",
      "little of the beauty of grace and symmetry. Its picturesque qualities\n",
      "are its sturdy habit, its great height, its dense and dark green\n",
      "foliage, its approach to a cylindrical shape, and its general\n",
      "eccentricity of growth. I have never seen a Hickory with long spreading\n",
      "branches like those of the butternut, nor with neat and prim foliage\n",

      "early as to astonish his neighbors in the outer world. In regard to the\n",
      "relative temperature of the woods and of the open plain in summer, he\n",

      "were cooler than the open country, in clear, calm weather, from about\n",
      "nine oâ€™clock in the morning until near noonday; after this time the heat\n",

      "diminished. Consequently the heat from the ground is radiated with great\n",

      "after it is cleared as when it was covered, it may at the same time be\n",
      "too cold for certain plants which were formerly its common productions,\n",
      "because there are no woods to protect them from the winds by day or from\n",
      "the cold caused by excessive radiation at night. Palestine, two thousand\n",
      "years ago, was a well-wooded country, and all the fruits of the\n",
      "sub-tropical climates were raised there to perfection by its ancient\n",
      "inhabitants. The date-palm, the fig-tree, and the olive grew there and\n",
      "bore fruit abundantly. Palestine is now a treeless country, and the same\n",
      "fruits are incapable of enduring its climate; yet recent observations\n",
      "have demonstrated that its climate is not colder than it was in the days\n",
      "of the kings of Israel. But as the country has been despoiled of its\n",
      "forests, these sub-tropical fruits are deprived of their natural\n",
      "conservatories, and cannot be raised without great labor and expense in\n",
      "preparing artificial protection for them. Let the forests be restored to\n",
      "the hills and mountains of Palestine, and, though the temperature of its\n",

      "atmosphere, as regulators of its humidity, equalizers of the electric\n",
      "fluid, and as safeguards against both drought and inundations; but I\n",

      "the actual creators, in many places, of the soil upon which they stand.\n",
      "The trees by means of their foliage are direct fertilizers of the ground\n",
      "they cover, causing it to increase in bulk as long as they stand upon\n",
      "it. But the leaves of trees are not the only source of this increase of\n",
      "bulk and fertility. The lichens and mosses, and various incrustations\n",
      "upon their bark, and the offal of birds, insects, and quadrupeds, all\n",
      "contribute to the same end. Hence the most barren situations will\n",
      "produce good crops for several years after the removal of their wood;\n",
      "and from these facts we may learn why a forest is still vigorous, though\n",
      "it has remained for centuries upon the same ground. If it were\n",
      "fertilized only by the decayed foliage of the trees, it would gradually\n",
      "lose its fitness to promote the health and growth of the timber. But the\n",
      "foreign matters I have enumerated, the decayed cryptogamous plants, and\n",
      "the relics and deposits of animals which have lived and died there,\n",
      "supply the soil with nitrogenous ingredients in which decomposed leaves\n",
      "are wanting.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what are the sources of all the matters which are furnished by the\n",
      "trees alone? They are chiefly the atmosphere and the deeper strata of\n",
      "the soil. The roots of the trees, penetrating to a considerable depth,\n",
      "draw up from the subsoil certain nutritive salts that enter into the\n",
      "substance of all parts of the tree. This is restored to the surface by\n",
      "every tree or branch that falls and moulders upon it, and the leaves\n",
      "increase its bulk still more by their annual decay. According to\n",
      "Vaupell, â€œthe carbonic acid given out by decaying leaves, when taken up\n",
      "by water, serves to dissolve the mineral constituents of the soil, and\n",
      "it is particularly active in disintegrating feldspar and the clay\n",
      "derived from its decomposition.â€ These facts explain why the surface\n",
      "soil in a forest may constantly increase in bulk, without communication\n",

      "below. Hence, by preserving a growth of wood upon all barren slopes and\n",
      "elevations, the farmer derives benefit from it, both as a fertilizer and\n",
      "as a source of irrigation to the lower part of the slopes or the base of\n",

      "barren or steep, are unprofitable alike for tillage or pasture. They\n",
      "require more manure than other grounds, and more labor in its\n",
      "distribution. Hence, if divested of wood, as I have often repeated, they\n",
      "are almost useless; while, if densely wooded, they fertilize and\n",

      "Sweet Viburnum. It is a tall and wide-spreading shrub, with numerous\n",
      "branches and dense and elegant foliage, making a compact and\n",

      "and with prominent veins. Many of our shrubs produce more showy flowers,\n",
      "but few surpass it in the beauty of its fruit. The berries are of the\n",
      "size of damsons, hanging profusely from the branches like clusters of\n",
      "grapes. They are dark purple when ripe, with a lustre that is not seen\n",
      "in the grape. Just before they ripen they are crimson, and berries of\n",
      "this color are often blended with the ripened fruit. Like the English\n",

      "limner of the forest, spreads over the earth new and enchanting\n",
      "pictures. Dim lights spring up daily among the shadows of the trees, and\n",
      "grove, copse, and thicket suffer a gradual metamorphosis. The woods are\n",
      "illuminated by such an array of colors that their late dark recesses\n",
      "appear to have the brightness of sunshine. Where a few days since there\n",
      "was but a shady obscurity of faded green, there gleams a luminous beauty\n",

      "colors of a flower-bed. The hues of sunrise are more ethereal and\n",
      "exhilarating; but there is a sober mellowness in the tints of autumn\n",
      "that inspires the most healthful temper of mind. Far and near, from the\n",
      "wooded hills that display a variegated spectacle of gold, scarlet, and\n",
      "purple; from turrets of rocks embroidered with ferns and sumach; from\n",

      "of gloom which is so manifest in them on a cloudy day in summer. In one\n",
      "respect the foliage itself is luminous, presenting warm colors that\n",
      "reflect light, so that the interior of a wood is actually brightened by\n",
      "the tinting of the leaves. I find but little pleasure in an evergreen\n",
      "wood at this time, unless it is illuminated by an occasional group of\n",
      "deciduous trees. Autumn is a sad time of the year,â€”the season of parting\n",

      "of nature for the refreshment of our spirits. All these things are\n",
      "beautiful even in cloudy weather, but the sun greatly enlivens the\n",
      "colors of the foliage, particularly when it goes down in a clear\n",
      "atmosphere, and every object is garnished with its beams, and mingles\n",
      "with golden reflections from hundreds of cottage windows. We watch their\n",
      "evanescent lights as they fade in the valleys and linger on the\n",

      "\n",
      "Though every one admires the beauty of autumn woods, not many are aware\n",
      "how imperfect are the colors that make up this gorgeous pageant. We\n",
      "speak of the scarlet and crimson of the maple, the oak, and the tupelo,\n",
      "and of many shrubs that equal them in brilliancy. But there is very\n",
      "little pure scarlet, crimson, or purple among these tints. If it were\n",
      "otherwise they would afford us less pleasure. In that case our senses\n",
      "would be intoxicated; now they are healthfully as well as agreeably\n",
      "stimulated. Pure colors spread over so wide an extent of surface would\n",
      "be too intense for perfect enjoyment. All the dyes of autumn foliage are\n",
      "sobered by the admixture of some earthy hue, something that prevents\n",
      "their rivalling the tints of heaven.\n",
      "\n",
      "Green and yellow are often seen in their purity in the leaves of trees;\n",
      "crimson and scarlet are seldom pure, except in some parts of the\n",
      "brightest leaves. Even their green is not perfect, save in that stage of\n",
      "their development that precedes their full expansion. After this period,\n",
      "as the landscape-painter well knows, all verdure is tarnished and rusty.\n",
      "Indeed, the colors of leaves will not bear comparison with those of\n",
      "flowers, either in purity or variety; yet when viewed from a distance,\n",
      "and illuminated by sunshine, they seem nearly pure. Red leaves of\n",
      "different shades in sunshine produce at a distance the effect of crimson\n",
      "or scarlet, chocolate hues that of purple, and browns that of orange.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hues of autumn are not very conspicuous before the middle of\n",
      "September, and it is worthy of notice that the brightest and purest\n",
      "colors are seen at the time when three fourths of the trees still remain\n",
      "unchanged. As one after another assumes its ruddy, golden and purple\n",
      "hues, the earlier and more brilliant drop their leaves; and some are\n",
      "entirely denuded, while others are fully covered with foliage and\n",
      "verdure. Even different individuals of the same species, of maples\n",
      "especially, manifest a great difference of habit in this respect, caused\n",
      "in some cases by the peculiarities of their situation. Trees in swamps\n",
      "and low grounds lose their leaves earlier than the occupants of a deep\n",
      "soil in the uplands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some species are perfectly uniform in their colors. The poplar and\n",
      "birch, for example, are invariably yellow; the sumach and whortleberry\n",
      "are chiefly red; while the maples display as many colors as if they were\n",
      "of different species. But each individual tree shows nearly the same\n",
      "every year, as apple-trees bear fruit of the same tints from year to\n",
      "year. Two red maples growing side by side are seldom alike, and in a\n",
      "group of them you will see almost as many shades of color as trees. Some\n",
      "are entirely yellow, others scarlet, some crimson, purple, or orange,\n",
      "others variegated with several of these colors. There is more uniformity\n",
      "in the tints of the sugar maple. I have seen long rows of this species\n",
      "that were only yellow and orange, though its colors generally vary from\n",
      "orange to scarlet. Purple and crimson are confined chiefly to the red\n",
      "maple; I have seen in different individuals of this species all the hues\n",
      "that are ever displayed in the autumn woods. The red maples, more than\n",
      "all other trees combined, are the crowning glory of a New England\n",
      "autumn. The sugar maple, though more brilliant, has a narrower range of\n",
      "colors.\n",
      "\n",
      "As early as the last week in August, we perceive the tinting of a few\n",
      "red maples, which always exhibit the earliest change. Sometimes a\n",
      "solitary branch is tinted, while the remainder of the foliage is green,\n",
      "as if something affecting its vitality had prematurely colored it.\n",
      "Frequently the coloring process begins at the top; the purple crown of\n",
      "autumn is placed upon the green brow of summer, and we behold the two\n",
      "seasons represented at once in the same tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first coloration is usually seen at the veins of the leaf, extending\n",
      "outwardly until the whole is tinted. Sometimes it appears in spots, like\n",
      "drops of blood upon the green surface; and in this case the leaf usually\n",
      "remains spotted. In the foliage of trees that assume a variety of\n",
      "colors, yellows generally predominate in the interior of the mass, red\n",
      "and purple on the outside. In the red maple, and less frequently in the\n",
      "rock maple when in a protected situation, the leaves are often formally\n",
      "variegated with figures of yellow, red, green, and purple. Those of the\n",
      "poison sumach, the cornel, and the snowy mespilus, are sometimes\n",
      "beautifully striated with yellow or orange upon a darker ground; but I\n",
      "have searched the woods in vain to find any other than a maple-leaf\n",
      "configurated like a butterflyâ€™s wing.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the foliage of the tupelo deep shades of purple first appear,\n",
      "brightening into crimson or scarlet before it falls. This tree more\n",
      "invariably shows a mass of unmixed crimson than any other species. Even\n",
      "in the maple, if the general presentation is red, you will find a\n",
      "considerable mixture of yellow. The colors of the scarlet oak are seldom\n",
      "pure or unmixed; but those of the tupelo are invariable, except as they\n",
      "pass through the gradations from purple to scarlet. If, therefore, the\n",
      "tupelo were as common in the woods as the maple, it would contribute\n",
      "more splendor to the scenery of autumn. There are many trees that never\n",
      "produce a red leaf. I have never found one in the foliage of the poplar,\n",
      "the birch, the tulip, the hickory, or the chestnut, which are all of\n",
      "some shade of yellow; but there are usually a few yellow leaves\n",
      "scattered among the ruddy foliage of any tree that assumes this color.\n",
      "\n",
      "When all the circumstances attending the season have been favorable to\n",
      "the tints of autumn, there is no tree of the forest that would attract\n",
      "more admiration from the beautiful sobriety of its colors than the\n",
      "American ash. But this tree is so easily affected by drought, that after\n",
      "a dry summer its leaves fall prematurely and its tints are imperfect.\n",
      "The colors of the ash are quite unique, and distinguish it from all\n",
      "other trees. Under favorable circumstances its coloring process is\n",
      "nearly uniform. It begins with a general impurpling of the whole mass of\n",
      "foliage nearly at the same time, and its gradual changes remind me of\n",
      "those observed in sea-mosses during the process of bleaching. There is\n",
      "an invariable succession in these tints, as in the brightening beams of\n",
      "morn. They are first of a dark bronze, turning from this to a chocolate,\n",
      "then to a violet brown, and finally to a salmon-color, or yellow with a\n",
      "slight shade of lilac. When the leaves are faded nearly yellow, they are\n",
      "ready to drop from the tree. It is remarkable, that, with all this\n",
      "variety of hues, neither crimson nor any shade of scarlet is ever seen\n",
      "in the ash. It ought to be remembered that the gradations of autumn\n",
      "tints in all cases are in the order of those of sunrise, from dark to\n",
      "lighter hues, and never the reverse. I make no reference to the browns\n",
      "of dead leaves, which are darker than yellow or orange, from which they\n",
      "turn. I speak only of the changes of leaves before they are seared or\n",
      "dry.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the middle of October, the oaks are the most conspicuous ornaments\n",
      "of the forest; but they are seldom brilliant. In their foliage there is\n",
      "a predominance of what we call leather-colors, with a considerable\n",
      "mixture of certain shades of red that are peculiar to the oak. We rarely\n",
      "find pure yellow or scarlet leaves in the foliage of any species of oak.\n",
      "The color of the scarlet oak is nearer a purple or crimson than any\n",
      "other shade of red. The white oak turns, with but little variation, to\n",
      "an ashen-purple or impure violet. The black and red oaks display varying\n",
      "and imperfect shades of drab and orange. The oaks are remarkable for the\n",
      "persistence of their foliage, and for the duration of their tints, which\n",
      "are chiefly the brown and russet of dead leaves with a lively polish.\n",
      "Long after other deciduous trees have become leafless, the various\n",
      "sombre shades of the different oaks cast a melancholy tinge over the\n",
      "waning beauty of the forest.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are wont to speak of trees as the principal objects of admiration in\n",
      "autumnal scenery, but the shrubs, though less conspicuous on account of\n",
      "their inferior size, are not less brilliant. It is also remarkable that\n",
      "reds predominate in the shrubbery, and yellows in the trees. Reds and\n",
      "purples distinguish the whortleberry, the cornel, the viburnum, and the\n",
      "sumach, including all their species. There is indeed so small a\n",
      "proportion of yellow in the shrubbery, that it is hardly distinguishable\n",
      "in the general mass of scarlet, crimson, and purple. Among trees, on the\n",
      "contrary, yellows prevail in all miscellaneous woods. They distinguish\n",
      "the poplar, the birch, the hickory, the tulip-tree, the elm, and a good\n",
      "proportion of the maples. It ought to be remarked, however, that there\n",
      "are more shrubs than trees that do not change materially, but remain\n",
      "green until the fall of their leaves. The alder remains green; and as it\n",
      "covers a large proportion of our wet grounds, it might seem to an\n",
      "observer in those situations that the tints of autumn were confined to\n",
      "the trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many persons still believe frost to be the great limner of the foliage,\n",
      "as if it were a sort of dyeing material. On the contrary, the slightest\n",
      "frost will destroy the tints of every leaf that is touched by it. It is\n",
      "not uncommon to witness a general tarnishing of the autumnal tints by\n",
      "frost as early as September. In some years they are spoiled by it before\n",
      "they have begun to be developed. An autumn rarely passes when the colors\n",
      "of the foliage are not half ruined before the time when they ought to be\n",
      "in their brightest condition. But the injury they receive from slight\n",
      "frosts is not apparent to careless observation. In the meridian of their\n",
      "beauty, heat will damage the tints as badly as frost. A very hot and\n",
      "sunny day occurring the first or second week of October makes almost as\n",
      "much havoc with the ash and the maple as a freezing night, fading their\n",
      "leaves rapidly and loosening their attachment to the branches, so that\n",
      "the slightest wind will scatter them to the ground. Yet the action of\n",
      "heat differs materially from that of frost. Frost imbrowns and crisps or\n",
      "sears the leaves, while heat only fades them to lighter and more\n",
      "indefinite shades. Frost is destructive of their colors, heat is only a\n",
      "bleaching agent. Cool weather in autumn without frost is necessary for\n",
      "the preservation of its seasonal beauty.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most brilliant autumnal hues appear after a wet summer, followed by\n",
      "a cool autumn, unattended with frost. Cool weather preserves not only\n",
      "the purity of the colors, but also the persistence of the foliage. If\n",
      "the early frosts are delayed, the tints are brighter for this delay\n",
      "while the weather remains cool. But a wet summer is so generally\n",
      "followed by premature cold, that the finest displays of autumn scenery\n",
      "are often suddenly ruined by a hard frost. Seldom are all the favorable\n",
      "circumstances for preserving the purity of the tints combined in any one\n",
      "season. Not more than once in six or eight years are both heat and frost\n",
      "kept away so as to permit the leaves to pass, unseared and untarnished,\n",
      "through all their beautiful gradations of color.\n",

      "There are several herbaceous plants that display tints similar to those\n",
      "of the woods; but they are not very conspicuous. I must not fail to\n",

      "of form, having neither leaves nor any very discernible flowers, which\n",

      "and branches are opposite, which increases their resemblance to the\n",
      "viburnum. They are very abundant in the Northern States; and it is\n",
      "remarkable that the different species might be distinguished by the\n",

      "leaves come out around the stem, not in a true alternate arrangement,\n",
      "but in imperfect whorls, and mixed with some that are opposite. The\n",
      "flowers are small, in irregular cymes; the fruit of a dark purple. It is\n",
      "found in swamps and low moist woods, and, with the other species,\n",

      "outside of the woods in the vicinity of Boston. Its flowers are white\n",
      "and rather inconspicuous, and are succeeded by clusters of pearly white\n",

      "distinguish them when divested of their leaves. It is the most abundant\n",
      "species in all the North-eastern States, including the British\n",
      "Provinces, where it serves more than any other tree, except the white\n",

      "a grayish-white trunk, and, as may be observed in winter, a dense and\n",
      "dark-colored spray. This species is called Poplar Birch, from the\n",
      "tremulous habit of the foliage, but is never assembled in large forest\n",
      "groups. Like the alder, it is employed by Nature for the shading of her\n",
      "living pictures, and for producing those gradations which are the charm\n",
      "of spontaneous wood-scenery. In all the Northern States, a pitch-pine\n",

      "The White Birch is remarkable for its elegance. It seldom divides the\n",

      "the magnitude of the same species in Europe. The durability of the bark\n",

      "remarkable. In the ruins of Dworotrkoi, in Siberia, a piece of birch\n",

      "pleasant memories. He who in his early days was a rambler in the woods\n",

      "flowers with the sex for whom the flowers seemed to be created, or with\n",
      "his male companions in pursuit of game. When journeying, these graceful\n",
      "trees, in company with the fragrant pitch-pines, have offered him their\n",
      "flickering shade, and along the sandy plains have defended him from the\n",
      "scorching heat of the sun, and spread a leafy canopy over his rustic\n",
      "path. In the sultry heat of summer noonday, I have often followed the\n",
      "course of some humble cart-path through their tangled undergrowth,\n",
      "gathering wild fruits from bush and bramble, or watching the singing\n",

      "They will not allow the birds a harbor of wood and shrubbery upon their\n",
      "own grounds, and they shoot those which I endeavor to entice by offering\n",
      "them a shelter in my farm. It is strange they cannot understand the\n",
      "mischievous character of their operations of smoothing and grubbing.\n",
      "That little rising ground you see before you, covered with trees and\n",
      "shrubs, is hardly more than a bare rock. It occupies about an eighth of\n",
      "an acre; but no other possible use could be made of it, except as a\n",
      "quarry. The little grove, or coppice, that stands upon it, is the most\n",
      "beautiful object in sight from my house. I have never allowed it to be\n",
      "disturbed or frequented by social assemblages. I keep it sacred for the\n",
      "use of the birds, and it is a perfect aviary. The birds that feed upon\n",
      "the destructive insects that infest my grounds are raised in that temple\n",
      "of the gods, which is watered by numerous little springs that ooze from\n",
      "the crevices of the rock. While they are rearing their young, all\n",
      "species, even if they live exclusively upon seeds after they have left\n",
      "their nest, feed their offspring upon larvÃ¦, which they collect from the\n",
      "nearest ground that affords them a supply. Hence I consider that bare\n",

      "we discover an apple-tree growing in a little clearing or open space, we\n",
      "find it invariably exempt from the ravages of the common apple-borer.\n",
      "The same exemption is observed in those fruit-trees that stand very near\n",
      "a wild wood, or any wood containing a spontaneous undergrowth. The\n",
      "explanation of this fact is that the wood affords a harbor to the birds\n",
      "that destroy these insects in all their forms. Orchards and gardens, on\n",
      "the contrary, which are located at any considerable distance from a\n",
      "wood, have not this security. Robins, it is true, are very abundant in\n",
      "orchards, which are their breeding-places; but robins, though the most\n",
      "useful birds that are known to exist, take all their food from the\n",
      "ground. They destroy vast quantities of cutworms and chrysalids buried\n",
      "in the soil, but they take no part of their insect food from the trees.\n",
      "The birds that perform this work are the sylvias, woodpeckers, creepers,\n",
      "and other species that live only in woods and thickets. Hence an orchard\n",
      "that is nearly surrounded by a wild wood of much extent is not badly\n",
      "infested by borers and other injurious insects.\n",

      "All species of insects multiply in cultivated grounds, while the birds,\n",

      "which admit the full heat of the sun to hasten the hatching of the eggs,\n",
      "gather no moisture to destroy them, _and harbor no bird to feed upon\n",
      "their larvÃ¦_. It is only since the felling of the forests of Asia Minor\n",
      "and Cyrene that the locust has become so fearfully destructive in those\n",
      "countries; and the grasshopper, which now threatens to be almost as\n",
      "great a pest to the agriculture of North American soils, breeds in\n",

      "Some men destroy trees and shrubbery in their borders, because they are\n",
      "supposed to harbor insects. But if this be true, it is because they are\n",
      "not sufficient in extent to shelter the birds that feed upon them. The\n",

      "of agriculture need nothing better than the under edge of a clapboard or\n",
      "a shingle whereon to suspend their cocoons or lay their eggs. So minute\n",

      "when hatching and when passing through all their transformations, till\n",

      "deprive them of their nurseries, or appreciably lessen their numbers.\n",
      "All inventions and appliances used to rid the trees and grounds of these\n",

      "It is not in the power of man, with all his science, unassisted by\n",

      "his own annihilation. But the farmer, when he destroys the border\n",
      "shrubbery in his fields and the coppice and wood on his hills,\n",
      "exterminates the birds by hosts, while the mischievous boy with his gun\n",
      "destroys only a few individuals. The clipped hedge-row, which is often\n",
      "substituted for a border of wild shrubbery, may assist in breeding\n",
      "insects; but the birds never build their nests in a hedge-row, unless it\n",

      "I have in another essay spoken of the scarcity of birds and other\n",
      "animals in the primitive forest. They are not numerous there, because\n",
      "the forest would yield them only a scanty subsistence. The forest border\n",
      "is their nursery and their shelter, but their best feeding-places are\n",
      "the cultivated grounds. There is not a single species whose means of\n",
      "subsistence are not increased by the clearing of the forest and the\n",
      "cultivation of the land; but they require a certain proportion of wild\n",
      "wood for their habitation. Very few species build their nests in the\n",
      "trees and shrubbery of our gardens, unless they are near a wood. In that\n",
      "case the catbird often nestles in the garden, that during the rearing of\n",

      "men and boys, and the clearing and grubbing habits of â€œmodel farmers,â€\n",

      "It has been observed that a meadow covered with luxuriant grass and\n",

      "proportion to the moist condition of the atmosphere, the cooling process\n",
      "over a grassy meadow is vastly greater than over a similar ground bare\n",
      "of vegetation. A wood, in like manner, by exhaling through its foliage\n",
      "the moisture it draws from the earth, cools the atmosphere in proportion\n",

      "A writer in â€œSillimanâ€™s Journalâ€ of 1833, who advances a very different\n",
      "theory to explain this phenomenon, makes a statement that favors my\n",
      "view: â€œIt appears to us that the existence and duration of the Indian\n",
      "Summer in this country has an important connection with the extensive\n",
      "forests and uncultivated lands peculiar to America. And it is worthy of\n",
      "remark, that, according to the recollection of the oldest of our\n",
      "inhabitants, its former duration was often three or four weeks; whereas\n",
      "its present continuance is short and uncertain, seldom exceeding ten or\n",
      "fifteen days. It appears also that this decline has been somewhat\n",

      "should resort to some unintelligible reasoning about the trade-winds,\n",

      "Summer. I can easily believe that before the encroachments upon the\n",
      "American forest were very extensive, this halcyon period of autumn may\n",
      "have occurred every year with great regularity. But since the clearing\n",
      "is almost universal, these conditions have been entirely changed. During\n",
      "the primitive state of the forest, its sudden denudation produced a more\n",
      "complete revolution on the face of the country than could possibly\n",
      "happen at the present time. The clearing of the woods has also cast down\n",
      "the barriers that impeded the circulation of the winds; at present these\n",
      "winds, sweeping freely over the continent, would counteract any\n",
      "influences, whatever they might be, that would produce an Indian Summer\n",

      "ten to fifteen days, and accompanied neither by wind nor rain. It has\n",
      "been incorrectly described by certain writers as attended with fog. The\n",
      "sky, though somewhat dim, was not obscured by vapor, but by a sort of\n",
      "ruddy haze, that veiled the prospect, as it often will during a series\n",
      "of warm, still days happening at any season. I draw my inferences from\n",
      "what I have reason to consider the most authentic accounts. The air was\n",
      "dry; and it could not have been otherwise. If it were moist, the\n",
      "increased radiation would soon dissipate the heat and put an end to the\n",
      "Indian Summer, which was never known to survive a copious and extensive\n",
      "fall of rain. The atmosphere was described as being obscured by smoke,\n",
      "rather than vapor, and this was most apparent in the latter part of the\n",
      "day. This smoky atmosphere has led some writers to suppose the whole\n",
      "phenomenon to be caused by fires in the woods.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to tradition, no part of the year was more delightful than\n",

      "which the trees sang to themselves, in the green solitudes of the\n",
      "forest. The whisperings and pipings of the _favorable spirit_ in the\n",

      "Certain trees belonging to the sacred groves gave oracular sounds, which\n",
      "were interpreted by musicians, and received by all men with faith and\n",
      "reverence. From the earliest ages men have listened to sounds from trees\n",
      "as music and as the voice of some deity, affording auguries of future\n",
      "events; for, as they reasoned, if a deity speaks to us, what sounds\n",
      "would be a more appropriate medium of communication than those of the\n",
      "trees which formed their temples and their altars? The sanctity\n",

      "impressiveness of their assemblages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every tree, when swept by the winds, gives a sound in harmony with the\n",

      "firs and pines remind the listener of the murmuring of waters, and\n",
      "inspire the most agreeable sensations. How often have I sat under the\n",
      "shade of a pine wood, and listened to the fancied roaring of the distant\n",
      "waves of the sea, as the winds passed through their foliage. When the\n",
      "breeze commences, we hear the first soft rippling of the waves; as it\n",
      "increases, succeeding waves of fuller swell flow tremulously upon the\n",
      "strand, and as the wind subsides melt into silence as they recede from\n",
      "the shore. Other trees produce very different sounds. The colors of\n",
      "their leaves, and the glittering lights from their more or less\n",
      "refractive surfaces, do not differ more than the modifications of sound\n",
      "drawn from them by the passing winds. Every tree is a delicate musical\n",

      "roadsides. It is found chiefly in copses on the sides of some gravelly\n",

      "on a clay level. It is remarkable for its slenderness of habit and the\n",
      "smoothness of its pale-green bark, which becomes whitish and rough as\n",
      "the tree grows old. Its principal defect is the thinness of its foliage\n",

      "It is heart-shaped, finely serrate, and when young is fringed with a\n",

      "From the earliest period of history, mankind have looked upon trees and\n",
      "woods with veneration, regarding them as special gifts of the gods to\n",
      "the human race. The ancient priests and philosophers used them as their\n",
      "places of retirement, both for the study of wisdom and the services of\n",
      "religion. Hence arose that early custom of planting trees in circles,\n",
      "forming a kind of amphitheatre, for religious assemblies. The teachers\n",
      "of philosophy used the same circular groves. These were held in the\n",
      "greatest reverence; and no man dared to commit the sacrilegious act of\n",
      "cutting down any part of them or defacing any of the trees. By means of\n",
      "these circular groves, wise and holy men obtained that seclusion and\n",
      "quiet which it was not easy to find in towns and cities. They were both\n",
      "schools and chapels, devoted to religion and philosophy. Hence the\n",
      "often-quoted remark of Pliny that â€œthe groves were the first temples of\n",
      "the gods.â€\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not improbable that many of the ancient superstitions relating to\n",
      "trees and groves originated with wise men, who believed that such holy\n",
      "fears alone would restrain the people from devastating the whole earth\n",
      "by the destruction of trees. Science now supplies mankind with rational\n",
      "motives for their preservation, in place of the religious scruples of\n",
      "ancient communities. I am inclined to believe that many a rational\n",
      "principle has been advocated by wise men under the guise of theology.\n",
      "The druidical priesthood foresaw that the oak, from the superior value\n",
      "of its timber, could not be saved from the woodmanâ€™s axe except by\n",
      "certain ceremonies on their part that should render it sacred in the\n",
      "eyes of the people. To impress this idea of its sanctity upon their\n",
      "minds, they made use of its leaves and branches to consecrate all\n",
      "important private or public transactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "In still more ancient times, the priests adopted the expedient of\n",
      "dedicating to some one of the gods, particularly to Jupiter, certain\n",
      "woods and groves, which were thenceforth held in veneration by all men,\n",
      "including even invading armies, whose chiefs, while respecting neither\n",
      "the lives nor the property of the enemy, held these consecrated groves\n",
      "sacred and inviolable. Hunting was forbidden within them by this\n",
      "superstition, and its injunctions were in all cases religiously\n",
      "observed. It is even asserted that the wild animals in these sacred\n",

      "Many persons formerly believed that trees felt the stroke of the\n",

      "ancient Greeks supposed certain trees to be inhabited by wood-nymphs,\n",
      "and that these deities uttered groans when the axe was laid upon the\n",
      "tree. These sounds gave origin to the sacred oracle of Dodona. There\n",
      "were two kinds of nymphs supposed to inhabit trees,â€”an inferior class\n",
      "that lived during the life of the tree, and died when it perished; and a\n",
      "superior class, like the dryads, who could pass at will from one tree to\n",
      "another. â€œOne might fill a volume,â€ says Evelyn, â€œwith the history of\n",

      "of Christmas festivities, of garlands of holly and trailing evergreens;\n",
      "but they have said little in prose or verse of the beauty or the\n",
      "sublimity of the seasonâ€™s ordinary aspects. More effort has been made to\n",
      "divert attention from winter, as entirely disagreeable, except within\n",
      "doors, than to lure the mind to its attractions. Its features have been\n",
      "described as only waste and desolate, and what is really admirable in\n",
      "them has been set aside as hardly worthy of thought. It is true there is\n",
      "not much variety in the countenance of winter. Its expressions are wild\n",
      "and rude, and partake more of sublimity than beauty. It presents an\n",
      "insufficient number of individual objects that can be brought to the aid\n",
      "either of painting or poetry; so that the composition must be made up in\n",
      "great degree by auxiliaries drawn from the imagination.\n",
      "\n",
      "Winter scenery is plainly monotonous. Instead of the charming mosaic of\n",
      "agriculture, displayed by summer and autumn in assemblages of fields,\n",
      "varying in color with the native hue of their different crops, we see\n",
      "either a dull universal waste of seared vegetation, or one broad expanse\n",
      "of whiteness, relieved only by the dark slender lines of fences and the\n",
      "broader stripes of roads and lanes winding over the face of the snow,\n",
      "interspersed with buildings and occasional woods and thickets. It is\n",
      "apparent, however, that snow increases the variety of the landscape,\n",
      "when it is mapped out with groves and fragments of forest, resembling\n",
      "wooded islets rising out of a white sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "The charm of winter scenery is greatly heightened by the clearing of the\n",
      "forest, which hides the surface of the snow and causes the scene to wear\n",
      "less of the aspect of grandeur than of desolation. Grandeur\n",
      "characterizes the view wherever an almost uninterrupted expanse of some\n",
      "miles of surface is completely whitened with snow. The buoyancy we feel\n",
      "when rambling over such a landscape resembles that produced by great\n",
      "altitude. Our greater physical vigor in clear winter weather prepares us\n",
      "to be agreeably affected by surrounding views, because our thoughts are\n",
      "not diverted by any sense of uncomfortable exertion, as in the languid\n",
      "heat of summer. Our constant transition from valley to open plain, from\n",
      "plain to hill, and from hill to wood, keeps the mind constantly amused\n",
      "with new views. We are also inspired by the grandeur of the whole scene,\n",
      "and do not, as in summer, give ourselves up to voluptuous sensations,\n",
      "but to enjoyments more purely intellectual.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our attention is not so often directed to the beauty of trees in their\n",
      "denuded state, as when they are dressed in foliage and adorned with\n",
      "flowers and fruit. But when we consider that for six months of the year\n",
      "all the deciduous trees, constituting the greater part of the woods, are\n",
      "leafless, we cannot regard their appearance at this time as an\n",
      "unimportant study. When trees are in leaf their primary qualities as\n",
      "objects in landscape are apparent; but many secondary points of beauty\n",
      "are almost entirely hidden under this mass of foliage. In winter, when\n",
      "the whole frame of the tree is exposed to view, the delicate sculpture,\n",
      "the forms, the angles, and the divergences of their branches, present to\n",
      "sight an infinite variety of picturesque appearances.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are certain trees, however, which are almost ugly in winter,\n",
      "though very beautiful in their summer dress. We see nothing attractive\n",
      "in the horse-chestnut, the sumach, the catalpa, and the ash, in their\n",
      "denuded state, when the coarseness and deformity of their spray become\n",
      "their salient points. Of these the horse-chestnut and the catalpa are\n",
      "not surpassed in beauty when they are in flower, nor the sumach in its\n",
      "autumnal dress, nor the ash either in summer or autumn. There is as\n",
      "great a variety in the style of the frame and framework of different\n",
      "trees as in the forms and colors of their leaves and flowers. Indeed, in\n",
      "some respects, trees are a more interesting study in their denuded state\n",
      "than when dressed in foliage. In this condition single trees become more\n",
      "special objects of attention than assemblages. Yet it is in winter that\n",
      "we perceive to the best advantage the characters of a forest vista. As\n",
      "we pass under the interlacing branches of the trees, we observe that\n",
      "peculiar arch formed by the meeting and contact of those on opposite\n",
      "sides of an avenue. We see this appearance only in a wide avenue, where\n",
      "the trees have grown since it was laid out. In the pathless wood, or in\n",
      "a path made through the forest after the trees have attained maturity,\n",
      "they have no well-formed lateral branches, and display above our heads\n",
      "only a formless canopy.\n",
      "\n",
      "We may observe in the spray of different trees an invariable\n",
      "correspondence with some of their other characters. Nut-bearers, for\n",
      "example, have a coarser spray than small seed-bearers; trees with large\n",
      "or compound leaves, than those with small or simple foliage; and trees\n",
      "with opposite, than those with alternate branches. Hence the oak and the\n",
      "hickory have a coarser spray than the birch and the elm, and the\n",
      "large-leaved poplar than the slender-leaved willow; the ash, with\n",
      "compound leaves, than the maple with simple leaves, though both have\n",
      "opposite branches. But if a tree bears a large nut, with leaves compound\n",
      "and branches opposite, like the horse-chestnut, it has no spray at all.\n",
      "The beech-tree, however, having a very small nut, has a fine and elegant\n",
      "spray, not surpassed by any tree of the forest. The opposite character\n",
      "of the smaller branches of certain trees is never continued in the\n",
      "larger divisions. But the angularity of the boughs of the oak is\n",
      "repeated in its angular spray, and the gracefulness of the principal\n",
      "branches of the elm, the birch, and the lime is traced through all their\n",
      "minute subdivisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "All these phenomena are interesting subjects of observation in winter\n",
      "wood-scenery. But the geometric beauty of the spray of trees is hardly\n",
      "less remarkable than its different colors. A maple wood, for example, is\n",
      "gray; a poplar wood is greenish olive; a wood consisting chiefly of\n",
      "limes, black birches, and cherry-trees has a dark shade. These\n",
      "differences of coloring, as seen in masses, when viewing the wood from\n",
      "an elevated stand, often excite the surprise of spectators; for it is\n",
      "only the most careful observers who have noticed this variety of shades.\n",
      "In many assemblages of wood that consist of an evenly promiscuous\n",
      "combination of species, we observe no such picturesque marks of\n",
      "distinction. But in all unique assemblages, of which our land affords\n",
      "very frequent examples, the differences between a maple, a poplar, a\n",
      "willow, and a lime grove are respectively very striking. The study of\n",
      "these shades is of considerable importance to the painter who should\n",
      "wish to give a true representation of a winter landscape, with reference\n",
      "chiefly to its wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of my most delightful wood rambles have been taken in the winter,\n",
      "which has always seemed to me less a season of melancholy than autumn.\n",
      "The sadness we feel while the leaves are falling around us and the light\n",
      "of noon seems but an ominous twilight passes away after these changes\n",
      "are completed; we resume our cheerfulness, and look forward in pleasant\n",
      "anticipation of spring. I have never allowed the winter to interfere\n",
      "with my rambling, save when the cold was intense, the weather wet or\n",
      "stormy, or the snow too deep for pedestrian excursions. These\n",
      "difficulties are seldom in the way for more than a fourth part of the\n",
      "season. When the snow has been hardened by repeated freezing and thawing\n",
      "so as to bear our footsteps, or when the ground is bare, a winter walk\n",
      "affords positive pleasure. At such times I have often passed a day in\n",
      "the woods, not only to enjoy the physical pleasure of air and exercise\n",
      "and the sweet odors of the pines, but also to note the changes in the\n",
      "face of nature, and the manners and habits of the few remaining birds\n",
      "and quadrupeds.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most noted circumstances attending a winter ramble in the\n",
      "woods is their silence. But this silence is an aid to thought as well as\n",
      "observation, and gives importance to every sound, as the white snow\n",
      "gives prominence to visual objects. When the winter sun is bright and\n",
      "the chilly atmosphere is calm, we may listen to the distant village hum\n",
      "with a sensation of melody; and we catch the gurgling sounds of streams\n",
      "under the glistening ice, and the voices of jubilant echoes, that send\n",
      "back in the general stillness every sound that penetrates their secret\n",
      "shell. The crumpling of the hardened snow under our feet produces a tone\n",
      "that silence alone could turn to music; and the rustling of every zephyr\n",
      "seems like a living note in this solitude. The occasional voices of\n",
      "winter birds have a charm hardly less delightful than the melodies of\n",
      "June, when every note is but the part of a general chorus. In winter we\n",
      "listen to sounds because they are few. Even the lowing of herds is\n",
      "musical, reminding us that our present solitude is encompassed by life\n",
      "and civilization.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wood is no longer a green recess, a temple of leafy beauty, a\n",
      "sanctuary of shade, an orchestra of melodious voices. There is perhaps\n",
      "less solemnity within it than when it is darkened by overarching\n",
      "foliage. The sun shines into it and renders some little nooks more\n",
      "cheerful than at any other season. I have often lingered in one of these\n",
      "sunny retreats to watch the chickadees and woodpeckers, that never fail\n",
      "to appear in sight, diligently exploring every branch of the neighboring\n",
      "trees. It is pleasant to woo this solitude when thus enlivened by the\n",
      "sun, to saunter along the turfy wood-paths, still green with clumps of\n",
      "moss and lycopodium, to look up into the lofty trees which have parted\n",
      "with their shade, observing the sculptured elegance of their limbs and\n",
      "the intricate beauty of their spray; pondering on the rare carvings of\n",
      "their bark, broken into many geometrical forms, and the curious devices\n",
      "of nature displayed in the incrustations upon their surface.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Larch, though one of the coniferous trees, is not an evergreen. It\n",
      "is generally known in this country as the Hacmatack, a name given it by\n",
      "the Indians. In favorable situations it attains a great height, though\n",
      "we are familiar with it as a tree of but ordinary size and stature. Its\n",
      "branches are very numerous, and irregularly disposed at right angles\n",
      "with the main stem, and not in very apparent whorls. The terminal\n",
      "branches are small and numerous, making considerable spray, but without\n",
      "much character. The American and the European Larch do not differ in\n",
      "their manner of putting forth their larger branches, nor in their\n",
      "botanical characters. They are distinguished, however, by an important\n",
      "difference in the style of their secondary branches. The European tree\n",
      "has a graceful hanging spray, drooping perpendicularly from its\n",
      "horizontal boughs, and swinging in the wind like that of the Norway\n",
      "spruce. The American tree has a shorter spray, not in the least pendent,\n",
      "with an appearance of more sturdiness, and less formality of outline. It\n",
      "displays, therefore, less of that beauty which is caused by flowing\n",
      "lines; on the other hand, it exhibits more firmness in its general\n",
      "aspect, and is a more stately tree. I prefer the American Larch because\n",
      "it departs further from that primness which distinguishes the coniferous\n",
      "trees. As it increases in height, it loses its tapering summit, and\n",
      "forms a head of flattened and irregular shape.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Larch bears no part in romantic history. Neither the ancient poets\n",
      "nor historians say much about it. Hence it is probable that it was not\n",
      "abundant in the forests of the southern part of Europe in the days of\n",
      "Homer and Virgil. Even its importance in furnishing the most durable\n",
      "wood for naval purposes is a discovery of modern times, and not until a\n",
      "very late period was it employed as an ornamental tree. The Larch is\n",
      "reputed in Europe to surpass all other trees as a fertilizer of the soil\n",
      "by the decomposition of its foliage. Another of its advantages, when\n",
      "used for plantations, is its thrifty habit on lofty sites, having a more\n",
      "elevated range than any other tree of equal importance. Gilpin remarks\n",
      "of the European tree: â€œIt claims the Alps and the Apennines for its\n",
      "native country, where it thrives in higher regions of the air than any\n",
      "other tree of its consequence is known to do, hanging over rocks and\n",
      "precipices which have never been visited by human feet. Often it is\n",
      "felled by some Alpine peasant and thrown athwart some yawning chasm,\n",
      "where it affords a tremendous passage from cliff to cliff, while the\n",
      "cataract, roaring many fathoms below, is seen only in surges of rising\n",
      "vapor.â€\n",
      "\n",
      "The American Larch tends to uniformity of shape when young and to\n",
      "variety when old. Yet the fine pyramidal forms of the young trees, and\n",
      "the fantastic and irregular shapes of those of older growth, are equally\n",
      "characteristic. The foliage is of a light green with a bluish tinge,\n",
      "turning to a deep orange in November, just before it falls. The bright\n",
      "crimson cones of the Larch, that appear in June, may be reckoned among\n",
      "its minor beauties. This tree is more abundant in Maine and New\n",
      "Hampshire than in any other part of the United States, though even there\n",
      "it is scarce compared with other conifers. Above the St. Lawrence,\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hemlock is confessedly one of the most beautiful of the coniferous\n",
      "evergreens, though rather narrow in its dimensions. The principal\n",
      "branches are small and short with very slender terminations, in which it\n",
      "differs from all the other spruces. The multitude of these slender\n",
      "sprays, and their rows of soft delicate leaves, cause those beautiful\n",
      "undulations that characterize the foliage of this tree when moved by the\n",
      "wind. The leaves, of a light green on their upper surface and of a\n",
      "silvery whiteness beneath, are arranged in a row on each side of the\n",
      "branchlets. But while those of the other spruces are sessile, those of\n",
      "the Hemlock have slender footstalks, yielding them a slight mobility.\n",
      "The spangled glitter of the foliage is caused by a slightly tremulous\n",
      "motion of the terminal sprays.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a deep wood the Hemlock shows some very important defects. There it\n",
      "forms a shaft from fifty to eighty feet in height without any diminution\n",
      "of its size, until near the summit, where it tapers suddenly, forming a\n",
      "head of foliage that projects considerably above the general level of\n",
      "the forest. The trunk is covered with dead branches projecting from it\n",
      "on all sides, causing it to wear a very unsightly appearance; and when\n",
      "the tree is sawed into boards, they are found to extend directly through\n",
      "the sapwood of the tree, making a hole in it as round as if it were\n",
      "bored with an auger. This is caused by the continued growth of the trunk\n",
      "of the tree after the decay of its branches, every year forming a new\n",
      "circle round the branch, but not inosculating with it, as in other\n",
      "trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "The full beauty of the Hemlock is displayed on the edge of a wood, or on\n",
      "a plain where it has grown without impediment, feathering down to the\n",
      "ground. Here we observe how much less formal it is in shape than other\n",
      "conifers. When there are no gaps in its ramification, the numerous\n",
      "branches are mostly in close contact at their extremities, so that, when\n",
      "viewed from the outside of the wood, it seems nearly one uninterrupted\n",
      "mass of foliage, hiding the interior of the tree almost entirely from\n",
      "sight. In its perfection, when it has enjoyed an isolated growth,\n",
      "without any mechanical accident to mar its symmetry, it presents a fine\n",
      "tapering form without stiffness, and a mass of glittering foliage with\n",
      "which that of but few other trees is comparable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The branches of the Hemlock are very numerous, perfectly horizontal, and\n",
      "remarkable for the absence of those regular whorls that distinguish\n",
      "other trees of this genus. They are put forth irregularly from all parts\n",
      "of the trunk, turning from their horizontal position gracefully upward,\n",
      "drooping a little at their termination, and endowed with great\n",
      "flexibility. The branches are minutely subdivided, forming with their\n",
      "leaves a flat surface, somewhat like the compound pinnate leaves of the\n",
      "cicuta, or poison hemlock. From this resemblance it undoubtedly obtained\n",
      "its name. These branches lie one above another, each bending over at its\n",
      "extremities upon the surface of those below, like the feathers upon the\n",
      "wings of a bird.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bark of the Hemlock is of a reddish brown, divided by furrows that\n",
      "separate it into scales. The young trees have a smooth bark, like that\n",
      "of the balsam fir. The cones are very small, numerous, and pendent, of a\n",
      "fine crimson color when they first appear, attached to the ends of the\n",
      "branches, and arriving at maturity in the autumn. The Hemlock occupies\n",
      "all kinds of soil, though trees of a large size are found only where it\n",
      "is deep and fertile. It is fond of moisture, often extending its\n",
      "graceful boughs from the summits of granitic rocks and declivities wet\n",
      "with perpetual springs. â€œThe Hemlock is natural to the coldest regions\n",
      "of America, and begins to appear about Hudsonâ€™s Bay, near Lake St. John;\n",
      "in the neighborhood of Quebec it fills the forests, and in Nova Scotia,\n",
      "New Brunswick, the States of Maine and Vermont, and a considerable part\n",
      "of New Hampshire, it constitutes three fourths of the evergreen woods.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Juniper is an historical tree, and has been the subject of many\n",
      "interesting traditions,â€”supposed by the ancients to yield a shade that\n",
      "was injurious to human life; the emblem of faith, because its heart is\n",
      "always sound; the bearer of fruit regarded as a panacea for all\n",
      "diseases, and a magic charm which was thrown on the funeral pile to\n",
      "protect the spirit of the dead from evil, and bound with the leaves to\n",
      "propitiate the deities by their incense. It is not improbable that the\n",
      "superstitious notions respecting the power of its fruit to heal diseases\n",
      "gave origin to the use of it in the manufacture of certain alcoholic\n",
      "liquors; and it is a remarkable fact that universal belief in its\n",
      "virtues as a panacea should have attached to a plant which is now used\n",
      "for no important medical purpose whatever save the flavoring of gin!\n",
      "\n",
      "The Juniper, very generally called the Red Cedar, and known in many\n",
      "places as the Savin, is well known to all our people, and is associated\n",
      "with the most rugged scenery of our coast. On all our rocky hills which\n",
      "have been stripped of their original growth the Juniper springs up as if\n",
      "it found there a soil congenial to its wants. On the contrary, the soil\n",
      "is very poorly adapted to it, for the tree never attains a good size in\n",
      "these situations. Its presence there may be attributed to the birds that\n",
      "feed in winter upon its fruit, and scatter its seeds while in quest of\n",
      "dormant insects among the sods. As we journey southward, we find this\n",
      "tree in perfection in New Jersey and Maryland; and in all the Atlantic\n",
      "States south of Long Island Sound the Junipers are large and thrifty\n",
      "trees.\n",

      "On our barren hills, near the coast, where they are so common as to be\n",
      "the most conspicuous feature of certain regions, they display a great\n",
      "variety of shapes and grotesque peculiarities of outline. Yet the normal\n",
      "shape of this tree is a perfect spire. When it presents this form, it\n",
      "is, in the true sense of the word, a beautiful object. Even its\n",
      "rusty-green foliage gives variety to the hues of the landscape, and\n",
      "heightens by contrast the verdure of other trees. This effect is the\n",
      "more remarkable at midsummer, when the green of the different trees has\n",
      "become nearly uniform in its shades. At this time the mixture of the\n",
      "duller tints of the Juniper is very agreeable.\n",

      "The Juniper is very full of branches, irregularly disposed at a small\n",

      "singular habit of this tree is that of producing tufts of branches with\n",
      "foliage resembling that of the prostrate Juniper, as if a branch of that\n",
      "shrub had been ingrafted upon it. The berries, which are abundant in the\n",
      "fertile trees, are of a light bluish color, and afford a winter repast\n",
      "to many species of birds, particularly the waxwing. The branches, when\n",
      "their extremities are brought into contact with the soil, readily take\n",

      "value for many purposes to which the wood is adapted; but this rapid\n",
      "diminution in diameter is one of its picturesque properties, and the\n",
      "cause in part of that spiry form which is so much admired in this tree.\n",
      "The lateral branches, always inserted obliquely, diminish in size\n",

      "observe in a symmetrical fir. Their leaves are longer, and their\n",
      "branches not so regularly given out in whorls. They are also more\n",
      "generally round-headed when old; their leaves are in small fascicles,\n",
      "containing from two to five, while those of the fir are arranged singly\n",
      "along the branch or round it. The pine contains a greater quantity of\n",
      "turpentine than any other family of resinous trees, and many of the\n",
      "species are of the highest value in the mechanic arts. In the New\n",
      "England States three species only are known, and of these two only are\n",

      "like the fir in symmetry, it resembles it the least in all other\n",
      "qualities, having the most flexibility of foliage of all the pines, and\n",
      "bearing its leaves in fives. The White Pine, according to Michaux, â€œis\n",
      "the loftiest and most valuable of the productions of the North American\n",
      "forest. Its summit is seen at an immense distance, aspiring to heaven,\n",
      "far above the heads of the surrounding trees.â€\n",

      "struck with its evident adaptedness to all purposes of shade and\n",
      "shelter, in its wide-spread, horizontal branches, and in its silken\n",
      "tufted foliage. It is not impenetrable to sunshine, but admits it in\n",
      "constant flickering beams of light; and we perceive immediately that\n",
      "there is no other tree in whose shade it would be more agreeable to\n",
      "recline on a hot summerâ€™s day, or under whose protection we might obtain\n",
      "a greater amount of comfort in winter. The uniform arrangement of its\n",
      "branches in whorls, forming a series of stages one above another, its\n",
      "tasselled foliage in long, silky tufts at the ends of the branches, and\n",
      "its symmetrical outline, constitute in the most obvious sense a\n",
      "beautiful tree. These tufts, though not pendulous, have none of the\n",
      "stiff bristling appearance of the other pines; and their verdure is of a\n",
      "sober, not a sombre tint, though rather dull in lustre.\n",

      "of its appearance, like the architectural proportions of a temple in\n",
      "which grandeur could not be produced without symmetry. This tree has\n",
      "much of the amplitude so remarkable in the cedar of Lebanon. Hence the\n",
      "look of primness, which the firs always retain, is counteracted by its\n",
      "nobleness and altitude. It is combined also with a certain negligent\n",

      "it may have derived from the easy motion of its foliage, the gentle\n",

      "intrinsic merits for the pleasure it affords either the sight or the\n",

      "pastoral meadow. It gives a darker frown to the projecting cliff, and a\n",
      "more awful uncertainty to the mountain pass or the craggy ravine. Over\n",
      "desolate scenery it spreads a cheerfulness that detracts nothing from\n",
      "its power over the imagination, while it relieves it of its terrors, by\n",

      "symbol of benevolence. Under its outspread roof, numerous small animals,\n",
      "nestling in the bed of dry leaves that cover the ground, find shelter\n",
      "and repose. The squirrel feeds upon the kernels obtained from its cones;\n",
      "the hare browses upon the trefoil and the spicy foliage of the\n",
      "hypericum, which are protected in its shade, and the fawn reposes on its\n",
      "brown couch of leaves, unmolested by the outer tempest. From its green\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Pitch Pine differs very widely in its style of growth from the white\n",
      "pine, and displays fewer of those points that excite our admiration. Its\n",
      "leaves form larger and more diffusive tufts, and are more bristling and\n",
      "erect from their superior rigidity. It is remarkable for its rough and\n",
      "shaggy appearance; hence its Latin name, _rigida_. Indeed there is not a\n",
      "tree in our forest that equals it in the roughness that is manifest in\n",
      "every part of it and in every stage of its growth. This is one of the\n",
      "most common trees in the Southern â€œpine barrensâ€; and some of the\n",
      "ancient pine woods in New England were made up principally of this\n",
      "species. Such was that extensive wood near Concord, N. H., known by the\n",
      "poetic appellation of â€œDark Plains,â€ and in the early part of the\n",
      "century occupying a wide flat region in the valley of the Merrimack\n",
      "River.\n",
      "\n",
      "This species does not give out its branches horizontally, nor in regular\n",
      "whorls. They run up at rather a wide angle with the stem, forming a head\n",
      "that approaches more nearly to a globular shape than that of any other\n",
      "of the American conifers. The branches have frequently a tortuous shape;\n",
      "for when crowded in a dense wood they do not so easily perish as those\n",
      "of the white pine, but turn in various directions to find light and\n",
      "space. They are likewise often bent downwards at their terminations,\n",
      "with a very apparent curvature. There is no conifer that displays so few\n",
      "straight lines in its composition; and, having no exact symmetry in its\n",
      "proportions, it may be mutilated to a considerable extent without losing\n",
      "its normal characters of beauty.\n",
      "\n",
      "In young trees of this species the whorls of branches may be plainly\n",
      "distinguished; but as the tree increases in size, so many members of the\n",
      "whorl become abortive that all regularity of staging in their\n",
      "arrangement is destroyed. As these branches are numerous, with but\n",
      "little space between the original whorls, they seem to project from\n",
      "every part of the trunk. This tree displays very little primness in its\n",
      "shape, or of a spiry form, save when it is a very young tree. A peculiar\n",
      "habit of the Pitch Pine is that of producing little branchlets full of\n",
      "leaves along the stem from the root upwards, completely enveloping some\n",
      "of the principal boughs. These are rarely anything more than tufts of\n",
      "leaves standing out as if they had been grafted into the bark of the\n",
      "tree. It seems to be stimulated to produce this anomalous growth by the\n",
      "loss of its small branches. It then soon covers itself with this\n",
      "embroidery, and thus garlanded presents a picturesque appearance more\n",
      "interesting than that of the perfect trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have seen very beautiful Pitch Pine trees of an abnormal shape, caused\n",
      "by the loss, when young, of the leading shoot. The lateral branches next\n",
      "below this terminal bud, being thus converted into leaders, produce two\n",
      "and sometimes three leading branches, giving the tree some of the\n",
      "characters of the deciduous species. The white pine is not improved by a\n",
      "similar accident, as it loses thereby the expression of grandeur that\n",
      "comes from the length and size of its lateral branches, which are always\n",
      "diminished by coming from two or more leading shafts. Michaux remarks\n",
      "that when Pitch-Pines â€œgrow in masses, the cones are dispersed singly\n",
      "over the branches, and they shed their seeds the first autumn after they\n",
      "mature. But on solitary trees the cones are collected in groups of four\n",
      "or five, or even a larger number, and will remain on the trees, closed,\n",
      "for several years.â€\n",
      "\n",
      "The Pitch Pine abounds all along the coast from Massachusetts to the\n",
      "Carolinas; but it is rare in the northern parts of Maine and New\n",
      "Hampshire and north of these States. It is said to have been very\n",
      "abundant in the southern part of New England before the eighteenth\n",
      "century, but large forests of it were consumed in making tar for\n",
      "exportation to Great Britain. The Pitch Pine woods of the present day\n",
      "consist of small stunted trees, showing by their inferior thrift that\n",
      "they stand upon an exhausted soil.\n",
      "\n",
      "The trees of this species, for the most part too homely and rough to\n",
      "please the sight, are not generally admired as objects in the landscape;\n",
      "but there is a variety in their shapes that makes amends for their want\n",
      "of comeliness and gives them a marked importance in scenery. We do not\n",
      "in general sufficiently estimate the value of homely objects among the\n",
      "scenes of nature, though they are indeed the groundwork of all charming\n",
      "scenery, and set off to advantage the beauty of more comely objects.\n",
      "They give rest and relief to the eye, after it has felt the stimulus of\n",
      "beautiful forms and colors, that would soon pall upon the sense; and\n",
      "they leave imagination free to dress the scene according to our own\n",
      "fancy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence I am led to prize many a homely tree as possessing a high value,\n",
      "by exalting our susceptibility to beauty, and by relieving nature of\n",
      "that monotony which is so apparent when all the objects in a scene are\n",
      "beautiful. We see this monotony in all dressed grounds of considerable\n",
      "extent. We soon become weary of their ever-flowing lines of grace and\n",
      "elegance, and the harmonious blending of forms and colors introduced by\n",
      "art. This principle explains the difficulty of reading a whole volume\n",
      "written in verse. We soon weary of luxuries; and after strolling in\n",
      "grounds laid out in gaudy flower-beds and smooth shaven lawn, the tired\n",
      "eye rests with tranquil delight upon rude pastures bounded by loose\n",
      "stone-walls, and hills embroidered with ferns and covered with boulders.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pines are not classed with deciduous trees, yet they shed their\n",
      "leaves in autumn with constant regularity. Late in October you may see\n",
      "the yellow or brown foliage, then ready to fall, surrounding the\n",
      "branches of the previous yearâ€™s growth, forming a whorl of brown fringe,\n",
      "surmounted by a tuft of green leaves of the present yearâ€™s growth. Their\n",
      "leaves always turn yellow before they fall. In the arbor-vitÃ¦ there is a\n",
      "curious intermixture of brown leaves with the green growth of the past\n",

      "When the Pilgrim first landed on the coast of America, the most\n",
      "remarkable feature of its scenery that drew his attention, next to the\n",
      "absence of towns and villages, was an almost universal forest. A few\n",
      "openings were to be seen near the rivers,â€”immense peat-meadows covered\n",
      "with wild bushes and gramineous plants, interspersed with little wooded\n",
      "islets, and bordered on all sides by a rugged, silent, and dreary desert\n",
      "of woods. Partial clearings had likewise been made by the Indians for\n",
      "their rude hamlets, and some spaces had been opened by fire. But the\n",
      "greater part of the country was darkened by an umbrageous mass of trees\n",
      "and shrubbery, in whose gloomy shades were ever present dangers and\n",
      "bewilderment for the traveller. In these solitudes the axe of the\n",
      "woodman had never been heard, and the forest for thousands of years had\n",
      "been subject only to the spontaneous action of natural causes. To men\n",
      "who had been accustomed to the open and cultivated plains of Europe,\n",
      "this waste of woods, those hills without prospect, that pathless\n",
      "wilderness, and its inhabitants as savage as the aspect of the country,\n",
      "must have seemed equally sublime and terrible.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when the colonists had cut roads through this desert, planted\n",
      "landmarks over the country, built houses upon its clearings, opened the\n",
      "hill-tops to a view of the surrounding prospect, and cheered the\n",
      "solitude by some gleams of civilization, then came the naturalist and\n",
      "the man of science to survey the aspect and productions of this new\n",
      "world. And when they made their first excursions over its rugged hills\n",
      "and through its wooded vales, we can easily imagine their transports at\n",
      "the sight of its peculiar scenery. How must the early botanist have\n",
      "exulted over this grand assemblage of plants, that bore resemblance to\n",
      "those of Europe only as the wild Indian resembles the fair-haired Saxon!\n",
      "Everywhere some rare herb put forth flowers at his feet, and trees of\n",
      "magnificent height and slender proportions intercepted his progress by\n",
      "their crowded numbers. The wood was so generally uninterrupted, that it\n",
      "was difficult to find a summit from which he could obtain a lookout of\n",
      "any considerable extent; but occasional natural openings exposed floral\n",
      "scenes that must have seemed like the work of enchantment. In the wet\n",
      "meadows were deep beds of moss of the finest verdure, which had seldom\n",
      "been disturbed by man or brute. On the uplands were vast fields of the\n",
      "checkerberry plant, social, like the European heath, and loaded half the\n",
      "year with its spicy scarlet fruit. Every valley presented some unknown\n",
      "vegetation to his sight, and every tangled path led him into a new scene\n",
      "of beauties and wonders. It must have seemed to him, when traversing\n",
      "this strange wilderness, that he had entered upon a new earth, in which\n",
      "nature had imitated, without repeating, the productions of his native\n",
      "East.\n",

      "Along the level parts of New England and the adjacent country, wherever\n",
      "the rivers were languid in their course, and partially inundated their\n",
      "banks in the spring, were frequent natural meadows, not covered by\n",
      "trees,â€”the homes of the robin and the bobolink before the white man had\n",
      "opened to them new fields for their subsistence. In the borders of these\n",
      "openings, the woods in early summer were filled with a sweet and novel\n",
      "minstrelsy, contrasting delightfully with the silence of the deeper\n",
      "forest. The notes of the birds were wild variations of those which were\n",
      "familiar to the Pilgrim in his native land, and inspired him with\n",
      "delight amidst the all-prevailing sadness of woods that presented on the\n",
      "one hand scenes both grand and beautiful, and teemed on the other with\n",
      "horrors which only the pioneer of the desert could describe.\n",

      "The whole continent, at the time of its discovery, from the coast to the\n",
      "Great American Desert, was one vast hunting-ground, where the nomadic\n",
      "inhabitants obtained their subsistence from the chase of countless herds\n",
      "of deer and buffalo. At this period the climate had not been modified by\n",
      "the operations of man upon the forest. It was less variable than now,\n",
      "and the temperature corresponded more definitely with the degrees of\n",
      "latitude. The winter was a season of more invariable cold, less\n",
      "interrupted by thaws. In New England and the other Northern States, snow\n",
      "fell in the early part of December, and lay on the ground until April,\n",
      "when the spring opened suddenly, and was not followed by those\n",
      "vicissitudes that mark the season at the present era. Such was the true\n",
      "forest climate. May-day came garlanded with flowers, lighted with\n",
      "sunshine, and breathing the odors of a true spring. It was then easy to\n",
      "foretell what the next season would be from its character the preceding\n",
      "years. Autumn was not then, as we have often seen it, extended into\n",
      "winter. The limits of each season were more precisely defined. The\n",
      "continent was annually visited by the Indian summer, that came, without\n",
      "fail, immediately after the fall of the leaf and the first hard frosts\n",
      "of November. This short season of mild and serene weather, the halcyon\n",
      "period of autumn, has disappeared with the primitive forest.\n",
      "\n",
      "The original circumstances of the country have been entirely\n",
      "revolutionized. The American climate is now in that transition state\n",
      "which has been caused by opening the space to the winds from all\n",
      "quarters by operations which have not yet been carried to their extreme\n",
      "limit. These changes of the surface have probably increased the mean\n",
      "annual temperature of the whole country by permitting the direct rays of\n",
      "the sun to act upon a wider area, while they have multiplied those\n",
      "eccentricities of climate that balk our weather calculations at all\n",
      "seasons. There are still in many parts of the country large tracts of\n",
      "wood which have not been greatly disturbed. From the observation of\n",
      "these, and from descriptions by different writers of the last century,\n",
      "we may form a pretty fair estimate of the character and aspect of the\n",
      "forest before it was invaded by civilized man.\n",
      "\n",
      "During this primitive condition of the country, the forest, having been\n",
      "left for centuries entirely to nature, would have formed a very\n",
      "intelligible geological chart. If we could have taken an extensive view\n",
      "of the New England forest, before any considerable inroads had been made\n",
      "by the early settlers, from an elevated stand on the coast, we should\n",
      "have beheld a dense and almost universal covering of trees. From this\n",
      "stand we might also trace the geological character of the soil, and its\n",
      "different degrees of fertility, dryness, and moisture, by the\n",
      "predominance of certain species and the absence of others. The\n",
      "undulations upon this vast ocean of foliage would come from the\n",
      "elevations and depressions of the ground; for the varying heights of the\n",
      "different assemblages of species upon the same level could hardly be\n",
      "perceived by a distant view. The lowest parts of this wooded region were\n",
      "at that period covered very generally with a crowded growth of the\n",
      "northern cypress, or white cedar. These evergreen swamps would\n",
      "constitute the darkest ground of the picture. The deep alluvial tracts\n",
      "would be known by the deciduous character of their woods and their\n",
      "lighter and brighter verdure, and the dry, sandy and diluvial plains and\n",
      "the gravelly hills and eminences by their white birches and tremulous\n",
      "poplars, their stunted pitch-pines and dwarfish junipers. For a century\n",
      "past the woods have been cleared mostly from the alluvial tracts; and\n",
      "the oaks, the hickories, the chestnuts, and other hard-wood trees, the\n",
      "primitive occupants of the rich and deep soils, have been succeeded in\n",
      "great measure by trees of softer wood, that originally grew on inferior\n",
      "land. The wooded aspect of the country cannot any longer be considered,\n",
      "as formerly, a good geological chart, except in some parts of Maine and\n",
      "the adjoining British Provinces.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the conditions most remarkable in a primitive forest is the\n",
      "universal dampness of the ground. The second growth of timber,\n",
      "especially if the surface were entirely cleared, stands upon a drier\n",
      "foundation. This greater dryness is caused by the absence of those vast\n",
      "accumulations of vegetable _dÃ©bris_ that rested on the ground before it\n",
      "was disturbed. A greater evaporation also takes place under the second\n",
      "growth, because the trees are of inferior size and stand more widely\n",
      "apart. Another character of a primitive forest is the crowded assemblage\n",
      "of trees and their undergrowth, causing great difficulty in traversing\n",
      "it. Innumerable straggling vines, many of them covered with thorns, like\n",
      "the green-brier, intercept our way. Immense trunks of trees, prostrated\n",
      "by hurricanes, lie in our path, and beds of moss of extreme thickness\n",
      "cover a great part of the surface, saturated with moisture. The trees\n",
      "are also covered with mosses, generated by the shade and dampness; and\n",
      "woody vines, like the climbing fern, the poison ivy, and the ampelopsis,\n",
      "fastened upon their trunks and trailing from their branches, make the\n",
      "wood in many places like the interior of a grotto. Above all, the\n",
      "traveller would notice the absence of those pleasant wood-paths that\n",
      "intersect all our familiar woods, and would find his way only by\n",
      "observing those natural appearances that serve as a compass to the\n",
      "Indian and the forester.\n",
      "\n",
      "In primitive woods there is but a small proportion of perfectly formed\n",
      "trees; and these occur only in such places as permit some individuals to\n",
      "stand in an isolated position, and spread out their arms to their full\n",
      "capacity. When rambling in a wood we take note of several conditions\n",
      "which are favorable to this full expansion of their forms. On the\n",
      "borders of a lake, a prairie, or an open moor, or of an extensive quarry\n",
      "that projects above the soil, the trees will extend their branches into\n",
      "the opening; but as they are crowded on their inner side, they are only\n",
      "half developed. This expansion, however, is on the side that is exposed\n",
      "to view; hence the incomparable beauty of a wood on the borders of a\n",
      "lake or pond, on the banks of a river as viewed from the water, and on\n",
      "the circumference of a densely wooded islet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fissures and cavities are frequent in large rocks not covered with soil,\n",
      "allowing solitary trees which have taken root in them to acquire their\n",
      "full proportions. In such places, and on eminences that rise suddenly\n",
      "above the forest level, with precipitous sides, overtopping the\n",
      "surrounding woods, we find individual trees possessing the character of\n",
      "standards, like those we see by roadsides and in open fields. But\n",
      "perfectly formed trees can only be produced in openings and on isolated\n",
      "elevations such as I have described; and it is evident that these\n",
      "favorable circumstances must be rare. The trees in a forest are like\n",
      "those human beings who from their infancy have been confined in the\n",
      "workshops of a crowded manufacturing town, and who become closely\n",
      "assimilated and lose those marks of individual character by which they\n",
      "would be distinguished if they had been reared in a state of freedom and\n",
      "in the open country.\n",
      "\n",
      "The primitive forest, in spite of its dampness, has always been subject\n",
      "to fires in dry seasons, which have sometimes extended over immense\n",
      "tracts of country. These fires were the dread of the early settlers, and\n",
      "countless lives have been destroyed by their flames often overwhelming\n",
      "entire villages. At the present time the causes of fire in the woods are\n",
      "very numerous; but before they were exposed to artificial sources of\n",
      "ignition it may have arisen from spontaneous combustion, caused by large\n",
      "accumulations of fermenting substances, or from lightning, or from the\n",
      "accidental friction of the trunks of half-prostrated trees crossing each\n",
      "other, and moved by a high wind. The forests in every part of the world\n",
      "have been subject to conflagrations; and there seems to be no other\n",
      "means that could be used by nature for removing old and worn-out\n",
      "forests, which contain more combustible materials than any young woods.\n",
      "The burned tracts in America are called barrens by the inhabitants; and\n",
      "as the vegetation on the surface is often entirely destroyed, the\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It is interesting to note the changes that take place from one season to\n",
      "another in the comparative beauty of certain trees. The Ash, for\n",
      "example, during the early part of October, is one of the most beautiful\n",
      "trees of the forest, exceeded only by the maple in variety of tinting.\n",
      "In summer, too, but few trees surpass it in quality of foliage, disposed\n",
      "in flowing irregular masses, light and airy, but not thin, though\n",
      "allowing the branches to be traced through it, even to their\n",
      "extremities. It has a well-rounded head, neither so regular as to be\n",
      "formal, nor so broken as to detract from its peculiar grace. When\n",
      "standing with other trees in midsummer, in the border of a wood, or\n",
      "mingled with the standards by the roadside, the Ash would be sure to\n",
      "attract admiration. But no sooner have the leaves fallen from its\n",
      "branches than it takes rank below almost all other trees, presenting a\n",
      "stiff, blunt, and awkward spray, and an entire want of that elegance it\n",
      "affects at other seasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ash is a favorite in Europe, though deficient there in autumnal\n",
      "tints. It is a tree of the first magnitude, and has been styled in\n",
      "classical poetry the Venus of the forest, from the general beauty of its\n",
      "proportions and flowing robes. The English, however, complain of the\n",
      "Ash, on account of its tardy leafing in the spring and its premature\n",
      "denudation in the autumn. â€œIts leaf,â€ says Gilpin, â€œis much tenderer\n",
      "than that of the oak, and sooner receives impression from the winds and\n",
      "frost. Instead of contributing its tint, therefore, in the wane of the\n",
      "year, among the many colored offspring of the woods, it shrinks from the\n",
      "blast, drops its leaf, and in each scene where it predominates leaves\n",
      "wide blanks of desolate boughs amid foliage yet fresh and verdant.\n",
      "Before its decay we sometimes see its leaf tinged with a fine yellow,\n",
      "well contrasted with the neighboring greens. But this is one of natureâ€™s\n",
      "casual beauties. Much oftener its leaf decays in a dark, muddy,\n",
      "unpleasing tint.â€\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ash is remarkable for a certain trimness and regularity of\n",
      "proportion, and it seldom displays any of those breaks so conspicuous in\n",
      "the outlines of the hickory, which in many points it resembles. The\n",
      "trunk rises to more than an average height before it is subdivided; but\n",
      "we do not see the central shaft above this subdivision, as in the poplar\n",
      "and the fir. Lateral branches seldom shoot from the trunk, save, as I\n",
      "have sometimes observed, a sort of bushy growth, surrounding it a little\n",
      "below the angles made by the lower branches. It is called in Europe â€œthe\n",
      "paintersâ€™ tree.â€ But George Barnard, alluding to this fact, remarks:\n",
      "â€œUnlike the oak, the Ash does not increase in picturesqueness with old\n",
      "age. The foliage becomes rare and meagre, and its branches, instead of\n",
      "hanging loosely, often start away in disagreeable forms.â€\n",
      "\n",
      "North America contains a greater number of species of the genus\n",
      "_Fraxinus_ than any other part of the globe. But three of these only are\n",
      "common in New England,â€”the white, the red, and the black Ash. The first\n",
      "is the most frequent both in the forest and by the roadsides, the most\n",
      "beautiful, and the most valuable for its timber. All the species have\n",
      "pinnate and opposite leaves, and opposite branches in all the recent\n",
      "growth; but as the tree increases in size, one of the two invariably\n",
      "becomes abortive, so that we perceive this opposite character only in\n",
      "the spray. The leaflets are mostly in sevens, not so large nor so\n",
      "unequal as in the similar foliage of the hickory.\n",
      "\n",
      "The white and the red Ash have so nearly the same external characters,\n",
      "that it requires some study to distinguish them. They do not differ in\n",
      "their ramification, nor in their autumnal hues. The black Ash may be\n",
      "readily identified by the leaves, which are sessile, and like those of\n",
      "the elder; also by the dark bluish color of the buds and newly formed\n",
      "branches, and the slenderness of its proportions. It seldom attains a\n",
      "great height or size, and is chiefly confined to swamps and muddy soils.\n",
      "The wood of this species is remarkable for strength and elasticity. The\n",
      "remarks of George Barnard respecting the localities of the Ash in Europe\n",
      "will apply to the American species: â€œThough seen everywhere, its\n",
      "favorite haunt is the mountain stream, where its branches hang\n",
      "gracefully over the water, adding much beauty to the scene. It is to be\n",
      "met with in every romantic glen and glade, now clinging with\n",
      "half-covered roots to a steep, overhanging cliff, and breaking with its\n",
      "light, elegant foliage the otherwise too abrupt line, or with its soft\n",
      "warm green relieving the monotonous coloring of the rocks or the sombre\n",
      "gray of some old ruin.â€\n",

      "There are some remarkable superstitions and traditionary notions\n",
      "connected with the Ash-tree. The idea that it is offensive, and even\n",
      "fatal, to serpents, is not of modern origin, though not a rustic laborer\n",
      "can be found who would not consider an Ash-tree planted before his house\n",
      "as a charm against their intrusion. According to Pliny, if a serpent be\n",
      "surrounded on one side by fire and on the other by a barricade of the\n",
      "leaves and branches of the Ash-tree, he will escape through the fire,\n",
      "rather than through its fatal boughs. It is related in the Edda that man\n",
      "was first created from the wood of this tree, and it is not improbable\n",
      "that this superstition has some connection with the fable of Adam and\n",
      "Eve, and through this with the supposed antipathy of the serpent for the\n",
      "Ash-tree.\n",

      "There is a saying in Great Britain, that, if the Ash puts forth its\n",

      "European travellers in this country frequently allude to the American\n",
      "forest as remarkable for its solitude and deficiency of animal life.\n",
      "Captain Hardy remarks that a foreigner is struck with surprise, when\n",
      "rambling through the bush, at the scarcity of birds, rabbits, and hares,\n",
      "and is astonished when in the deepest recesses of the wild country he\n",
      "sees but little increase of their numbers. When paddling his canoe\n",
      "through lake and river, he will startle but few pairs of exceedingly\n",
      "timid waterfowl where in Europe they swarm in multitudes. This scarcity\n",
      "of animals, I would remark, is not peculiar to the American wilderness.\n",
      "The same fact has been observed in extensive forests both in Europe and\n",
      "Asia; and in proportion as the traveller penetrates into their interiors\n",
      "he finds a smaller number of animals of almost every species. Birds,\n",
      "insects, and quadrupeds will multiply, like human beings, in a certain\n",
      "ratio with the progress of agriculture, so long as there remains a\n",
      "sufficiency of wild wood to afford them a refuge and a home. They use\n",

      "things which, had any one accompanied me, would have escaped my\n",
      "observation. After passing a few weeks of the winter in Nashville, I\n",
      "directed my course through Tennessee and Virginia, and was often led\n",

      "Nashville, which was surrounded with immense cornfields and cotton\n",
      "plantations. But while walking through the country I could not help\n",
      "observing the scarcity of birds and small quadrupeds in the woods\n",
      "whenever I was at a long distance from any village or habitation.\n",
      "Sometimes night would draw near before I had reached a hamlet or\n",
      "farm-house, where I might take lodging. On such occasions the silence of\n",

      "after the trees have been felled, a very different kind, if it be left\n",
      "to its spontaneous action. The laws affecting such rotations have been\n",
      "very well ascertained, and a careful investigation of the subject would\n",
      "undoubtedly reveal many curious facts not yet known. If the stumps of\n",
      "the trees, consisting of oak, ash, maple, and some other deciduous\n",
      "kinds, remain after the wood is felled, they will throw up suckers, and\n",
      "the succeeding timber will be an inferior growth of the original wood.\n",
      "But if the stumps and roots of the trees should be entirely removed, it\n",
      "would be more difficult to determine what would be the character of the\n",
      "next spontaneous growth. It would probably be planted by the kinds that\n",
      "prevail in the neighboring forests, and it would depend on the character\n",
      "of the soil whether the hard or soft-wood trees would finally\n",
      "predominate.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is an important chemical agency at work, that originally\n",
      "determines the distribution of forests, and afterwards their rotation.\n",
      "The hard-wood trees require more potash and a deeper soil than the\n",
      "coniferous and soft-wood trees. Hence they are found chiefly on alluvial\n",
      "plains and the lower slopes of mountains, where the soil is deep and\n",
      "abounds in all valuable ingredients for the support of vegetation. Pines\n",
      "and firs, on the contrary, though frequently discovered of an immense\n",
      "size on alluvial soils, are generally crowded out of such grounds by the\n",
      "superior vigor of the hard-wood trees; and they can only maintain their\n",
      "supremacy on barren and sandy levels, and the thin soils of mountain\n",
      "declivities, too meagre to support the growth of timber of superior\n",
      "kinds. But a wood must stand a great many years, several centuries\n",
      "perhaps, after its spontaneous restoration, before this order of nature\n",
      "could be fully established. We must observe the spontaneous growth and\n",
      "distribution of herbaceous plants in different soils to ascertain these\n",
      "laws, which are the same in a field as in a forest.\n",
      "\n",
      "When any growth of hard wood has been felled and the whole removed from\n",
      "the ground, the soil, having been exhausted of its potash, cannot\n",
      "support a new and vigorous growth of the same kind of timber. The\n",
      "succession will consist of a meagre growth of the same species from\n",
      "seeds already planted there; but the white birch and poplar, especially\n",
      "the large American aspen, usually predominate in clearings in this part\n",
      "of the country. When a pine wood is felled, it is succeeded by an\n",
      "inferior growth of conifers, and a species of dwarf or scrub oak.\n",
      "Seldom, indeed, after any kind of wood has been cut down and carried\n",
      "away from the spot, can the exhausted soil support another that is not\n",
      "inferior in quality or species. Though an oak wood may be succeeded by\n",
      "pines, a pine wood will not be succeeded by oaks or any other hard\n",
      "timber, unless the trees were burned and their ashes restored to the\n",
      "soil. Hence we may account for the fact that poplars, white birches, and\n",
      "wild-cherry-trees, occupy a larger proportion of the ground that is now\n",
      "covered with wood than they did a century ago, in all parts of the\n",

      "I have already alluded to the well-known fact, that the generic\n",

      "by art. The swelling of the bark occasioned by the flow of sap gives the\n",
      "whole mass a livelier hue. This appearance is very evident in the\n",
      "peach-tree, in willows and poplars, in the snowy mespilus, and in all\n",
      "trees with a long and slender spray. Hence the ashen green of the\n",
      "poplar, the golden green of the willow, and the dark crimson of the\n",
      "peach-tree, the wild rose, and the red osier, are perceptibly heightened\n",

      "their autumnal dress, forming a yellow shade of green. The tender leaves\n",
      "of the maple and of the different oaks are all greenish purple of\n",
      "different shades. On the other hand, the foliage of trees that do not\n",
      "change their color in the autumn displays only a diluted shade of green,\n",
      "in its half-unfolded state. This remark, however, is not universal in\n",

      "of a dark maroon, and the crimson flowers of the red maple, coming\n",

      "It does not exhibit the sturdy ruggedness of the oak; it is not so\n",
      "evidently defiant of wind and tempest. It seems, indeed, to make no\n",
      "outward pretensions of strength. It bends to the breeze which the oak\n",
      "defies, and is more seldom, therefore, broken by the wind. The Elm is\n",
      "especially the wayside tree of New England, and it forms the most\n",
      "remarkable feature of our domestic landscape. If there be in any other\n",
      "section of our land as many, they are individuals mingled with the\n",
      "forest, and are not so frequent by the roadsides. In this part of the\n",
      "country the Elm has been planted and cherished from the earliest period\n",
      "of our history, and the inhabitants have always looked upon it with\n",
      "admiration, and valued it as a landscape ornament above every other\n",
      "species. It is the most drooping of the drooping trees, except the\n",
      "willow, which it surpasses in grandeur and in the variety of its forms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though the Elm has never been consecrated by the muse of classic song,\n",
      "or dignified by making a figure in the paintings of the old masters, the\n",
      "native inhabitant of New England associates the varied forms of this\n",
      "tree with all that is delightful in the scenery or memorable in the\n",
      "history of our land. All spacious avenues are bordered with elms, and\n",
      "their magnificent rows are everywhere familiar to his sight. He has seen\n",
      "them extending their broad and benevolent arms over many a hospitable\n",
      "mansion and many a humble cottage, and equally harmonizing with all.\n",
      "They meet his sight in the public grounds of the city with their ample\n",
      "shade and flowing spray; and he beholds them in the clearing, where they\n",
      "were left by the woodman to stand as solitary landmarks of the\n",
      "devastated space. Every year of his life he has seen the beautiful\n",
      "hangbird weave his pensile nest upon the long and flexible branches,\n",
      "secure from the reach of every foe. From its vast dome of branches and\n",
      "foliage he has listened to the songs of the late and early birds, and\n",
      "under its canopy he has witnessed many a scene of rustic amusement.\n",
      "\n",
      "To a native of New England, therefore, the Elm has a character more\n",
      "nearly approaching that of sacredness than any other tree. Setting aside\n",
      "the pleasure derived from it as an object of material beauty, it reminds\n",
      "him of the familiar scenes of home and the events of his early life. How\n",
      "many a happy assemblage of children and young persons has been gathered\n",
      "under its shade in the sultry noons of summer! How many a young May\n",

      "In my own mind the Elm is intimately allied with those old\n",
      "dwelling-houses which were built in the early part of the last century,\n",
      "and form one of the principal remaining features of New England home\n",
      "architecture during that period. They are known by their broad and ample\n",
      "but low-studded rooms, their two stories in front, their numerous\n",
      "windows with small panes, their single chimney in the centre of the\n",
      "roof, that sloped down to one story in the rear, and their general\n",
      "homely appearance, reminding us of the simplicity of life that\n",
      "characterized our people before the Revolution. Their very homeliness is\n",
      "attractive, by leaving the imagination free to dwell upon their\n",
      "interesting suggestions. Not many of these venerable houses are now\n",
      "extant; but whenever we see one, it is almost invariably accompanied by\n",
      "its Elm, standing upon the green open space that slopes down from it in\n",
      "front, waving its long branches in melancholy grandeur above the old\n",
      "homestead, and drooping, as with sorrow, over the infirmities of its old\n",
      "companion of a century.\n",
      "\n",
      "Early in April the Elm puts forth its flowers, of a dark maroon color,\n",
      "in numerous clusters, fringing the long terminal spray, and filling up\n",
      "the whole space so effectually that the branches can hardly be seen;\n",
      "they appear at the same time with the crimson flowers of the red maple,\n",
      "and give the tree a very sombre appearance. The seeds ripen early, and\n",
      "being small and chaffy are wafted in all directions and carried to great\n",
      "distances by the wind. In the early part of June, soon after the leaves\n",
      "are expanded, the Elm displays the most beauty. At this time only can\n",
      "its verdure be considered brilliant: for the leaf soon fades to a dull\n",
      "green, and displays no tints, except that of a rusty yellow in the\n",
      "autumn. In perfectly healthy elms, standing on a deep soil, the\n",
      "brightness of the foliage is retained to a later period; but the trees\n",
      "near Boston have suffered so much from the ravages of the cankerworm\n",
      "that their health is injured, and their want of vitality is shown by the\n",
      "premature fading and dropping of their foliage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing can exceed the American Elm in a certain harmonious combination\n",
      "of sturdiness and grace,â€”two qualities which are seldom united. Along\n",
      "with its superior magnitude, we observe a great length and slenderness\n",
      "of its branches, without anything in the combination that indicates\n",
      "weakness. It is very agreeable to witness the union, under any\n",
      "circumstances, of two interesting or admirable traits of character which\n",
      "are supposed to be incompatible. Hence the complacency we feel when we\n",
      "meet a brave man who is amiable and polite, or a learned man who is\n",
      "neither reserved nor pedantic. A slender vine, supported by a sturdy\n",
      "tree, forms a very agreeable image; not less delightful is that\n",
      "consonance we perceive in a majestic Elm, formed by the union of\n",
      "grandeur with the gracefulness of its own flowing drapery.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Elm is generally subdivided into several equal branches, diverging\n",
      "from a common centre at a small distance above the ground. The height of\n",
      "this divergence depends on the condition of the tree when it was a\n",
      "seedling, whether it grew in a forest or in an open field; and the angle\n",
      "made by these branches is much wider when it obtained its growth in an\n",
      "isolated situation. The shape of different elms varies more than that of\n",
      "any other known species. It is indeed almost the only tree which may be\n",
      "said to exhibit more than one normal figure, setting aside those\n",
      "variations of form which are the natural effects of youth and age. The\n",
      "American Elm never displays one central shaft to which the branches are\n",
      "subordinate, like the English Elm; or rather, I should say, that when it\n",
      "has only a single shaft it is without any limbs, and is surrounded only\n",
      "with short and slender twigs. This leads me to speak of its normal\n",

      "from the time it was a seedling until it attains its full stature in an\n",
      "open space. It then shows a broad hemispherical head, formed by branches\n",
      "of nearly equal size, issuing chiefly from a common centre, diverging\n",
      "first at a small angle, and gradually spreading outward with a curve\n",
      "that may be traced throughout their length. A considerable number of our\n",

      "One of the most admirable of these different forms is that of the vase.\n",
      "The base is represented by the roots of the tree as they project above\n",
      "the ground, making a sort of pedestal for the trunk. The neck of the\n",
      "vase is the trunk before it is subdivided. The middle of the vase\n",
      "consists of the lower part of the branches as they swell outwards with a\n",
      "graceful curve, then gradually diverge, until they bend over at their\n",
      "extremities and form the lip of the vase by a circle of terminal spray.\n",
      "Perfect specimens of this beautiful form are rare, but in a row or a\n",

      "the general admiration of this tree, that great numbers of them are left\n",
      "in clearings in all parts of the country. The State of Maine abounds in\n",
      "trees of this form, sending forth almost perpendicularly a number of\n",
      "branches, that spread out rather suddenly at a considerable height, in\n",
      "the shape of an umbrella. Trees of this type have much of that grandeur\n",
      "which is caused by great height and small dimensions, as observed in a\n",
      "palm-tree. A remarkable trait in the character of the Elm is, that,\n",
      "unlike other trees, it seldom loses its beauty, and is often improved in\n",
      "shape, by growing while young in a dense assemblage. It is simply\n",
      "modified into a more slender shape, usually subdivided very near the\n",
      "ground into several branches that diverge but little until they reach\n",

      "regarded as of a normal character, is the plume, caused by some peculiar\n",
      "conditions attending its early growth. The shaft is sometimes double,\n",
      "but usually not divided at all, except into two or three small branches\n",
      "at its very summit. It is perpendicular to near three fourths of its\n",
      "height, and then bends over, like one of the outer branches of a\n",
      "normal-shaped Elm. This whole tree, whether double or single, is covered\n",
      "from the ground to its summit with a dense embroidery of vine-like twigs\n",
      "that cluster round it in all ways, often inverted, as if it were covered\n",
      "with a woody vine. The cause of this form seems to be the removal of the\n",
      "tree into an uncongenial soil, that is too scanty and innutritious to\n",
      "sustain a healthy growth. Yet I have seen some trees of this shape in\n",

      "about ten acres, surrounded by a narrow stream that was fed by a steep\n",
      "ridge forming a sort of amphitheatre round more than half its\n",
      "circumference. The ridge was a declivity of near a hundred feet in\n",
      "height, and so steep that you could climb it only by taking hold of the\n",
      "trees and bushes that covered it. The whole surface consisted of a thin\n",
      "stratum of soil deposited upon a slaty rock; but the growth of trees\n",
      "upon this slope was beautiful and immense, and the water that was\n",
      "constantly trickling from a thousand fountains kept the ground all the\n",
      "year green with mosses and ferns, and gay with many varieties of\n",
      "flowers. The soil was so rich in the meadow enclosed by this ridge, and\n",
      "annually fertilized by the _dÃ©bris_ washed from the hills, that the\n",
      "proprietor every summer filled his barns with hay, which was obtained\n",
      "from it without any cultivation.\n",
      "\n",
      "I revisited this spot a few years since, after a long period of absence.\n",
      "A new owner, â€œa man of progress and enterprise,â€ had felled the trees\n",
      "that grew so beautifully on the steep sides of this elevation, and\n",
      "valley and hill have become a dreary and unprofitable waste. The thin\n",
      "soil that sustained the forest, no longer protected by the trees and\n",
      "their undergrowth, has been washed down into the valley, leaving nothing\n",
      "but a bald, rocky surface, whose hideousness is scarcely relieved by a\n",
      "few straggling vines. The valley is also ruined; for the inundations to\n",
      "which it is subject after any copious rain destroy every crop that is\n",
      "planted upon it, and render it impracticable for tillage. It is covered\n",
      "with sand heaps; the little stream that glided round it, fringed with\n",
      "azaleas and wild roses, has disappeared, and the land is reduced to a\n",
      "barren pasture.\n",
      "\n",
      "The general practice of the pioneers of civilization on this continent\n",
      "was to cut down the wood chiefly from the uplands and the lower slopes\n",
      "of the hills and mountains. They cleared those tracts which were most\n",
      "valuable for immediate use and cultivation. Necessity led them to pursue\n",
      "the very course required by the laws of nature for improving the soil\n",
      "and climate. The first clearings were made chiefly for purposes of\n",
      "agriculture; and as every farm was surrounded by a rampart of woods, it\n",
      "was sheltered from the force of the winds and pleasantly open to the\n",
      "sun. But when men began to fell the woods to supply the demands of towns\n",
      "and cities for fuel and lumber, these clearings were gradually deprived\n",
      "of their shelter, by levelling the surrounding forest and opening the\n",
      "country to the winds from every quarter. But the clearing of the wood\n",
      "from the plains, while it has rendered the climate more unstable, has\n",
      "not been the cause of inundations or the diminution of streams. This\n",
      "evil has been produced by clearing the mountains and lesser elevations\n",
      "having steep or rocky sides; and if this destructive work is not checked\n",
      "by legislation or by the wisdom of the people, plains and valleys now\n",
      "green and fertile will become profitless for tillage or pasture, and the\n",
      "advantages we shall have sacrificed will be irretrievable in the\n",
      "lifetime of a single generation. The same indiscriminate felling of\n",
      "woods has rendered many a once fertile region in Europe barren and\n",
      "uninhabitable, equally among the cold mountains of Norway and the sunny\n",
      "plains of Brittany.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our climate suffers more than formerly from summer droughts. Many\n",
      "ancient streams have entirely disappeared, and a still greater number\n",
      "are dry in summer. Boussingault mentions a fact that clearly illustrates\n",
      "the condition to which we may be exposed in thousands of locations on\n",
      "this continent. In the island of Ascension there was a beautiful spring,\n",
      "situated at the foot of a mountain which was covered with wood. By\n",
      "degrees the spring became less copious, and at length failed. While its\n",
      "waters were annually diminishing in bulk, the mountain had been\n",
      "gradually cleared of its forest. The disappearance of the spring was\n",
      "attributed to the clearing. The mountain was again planted, and as the\n",
      "new growth of wood increased, the spring reappeared, and finally\n",
      "attained its original fulness. More to be dreaded than drought, and\n",
      "produced by the same cause,â€”the clearing of steep declivities of their\n",
      "wood,â€”are the excessive inundations to which all parts of the country\n",
      "are subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "If it were in the power of man to dispose his woods and tillage in the\n",
      "most advantageous manner, he might not only produce an important\n",
      "amelioration of the general climate, but he might diminish the frequency\n",
      "and severity both of droughts and inundations, and preserve the general\n",
      "fulness of streams. If every man were to pursue that course which would\n",
      "protect his own grounds from these evils, it would be sufficient to\n",
      "bring about this beneficent result. If each owner of land would keep all\n",
      "his hills and declivities, and all slopes that contain only a thin\n",
      "deposit of soil or a quarry, covered with forest, he would lessen his\n",
      "local inundations from vernal thaws and summer rains. Such a covering of\n",
      "wood tends to equalize the moisture that is distributed over the land,\n",
      "causing it, when showered upon the hills, to be retained by the\n",
      "mechanical action of the trees and their undergrowth of shrubs and\n",
      "herbaceous plants, and by the spongy surface of the soil underneath\n",
      "them, made porous by mosses, decayed leaves, and other _dÃ©bris_, so that\n",
      "the plains and valleys have a moderate oozing supply of moisture for a\n",
      "long time after every shower. Without this covering, the water when\n",
      "precipitated upon the slopes, would immediately rush down over an\n",
      "unprotected surface in torrents upon the space below.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every one has witnessed the effects of clearing the woods and other\n",
      "vegetation from moderate declivities in his own neighborhood. He has\n",
      "observed how rapidly a valley is inundated by heavy showers, if the\n",
      "rising grounds that form its basin are bare of trees and planted with\n",
      "the farmerâ€™s crops. Even grass alone serves to check the rapidity with\n",
      "which the water finds its way to the bottom of the slope. Let it be\n",
      "covered with bushes and vines, and the water flows with a speed still\n",
      "more diminished. Let this shrubbery grow into a forest, and the valley\n",
      "would never be inundated except by a long-continued and flooding rain.\n",
      "Woods and their undergrowth are indeed the only barriers against\n",
      "frequent and sudden inundations, and the only means in the economy of\n",
      "nature for preserving an equal fulness of streams during all seasons of\n",
      "the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first thought, it may seem strange that the clearing of forests\n",
      "should be equally the cause both of drought and inundations; but these\n",
      "apparently incompatible facts are easily explained by considering the\n",
      "different effects produced by woods standing in different situations. An\n",
      "excess of moisture in the valleys comes from the drainage of the hills,\n",
      "and the same conditions that will cause them to be dried up at certain\n",
      "times will cause them to be flooded at others. Natureâ€™s design seems to\n",
      "be to preserve a constant moderate fulness of streams and standing\n",
      "water. This purpose she accomplishes by clothing the general surface of\n",
      "the country with wood. When man disturbs this arrangement, he may\n",
      "produce evil consequences which he had never anticipated. We are not,\n",
      "however, to conclude that we may not improve the soil and climate by\n",
      "changing the original condition of this wooded surface. The clearing of\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "While Nature, in the forms of trees, in the color of their foliage and\n",
      "the gracefulness of their spray, has displayed a great variety of\n",
      "outline and tinting, and provided a constant entertainment for the\n",
      "sight, she has increased their attractions by endowing them with a\n",
      "different susceptibility to motion from the action of the winds. In\n",
      "their motions we perceive no less variety than in their forms. The\n",
      "different species differ like animals; some being graceful and easy,\n",
      "others stiff and awkward; some calm and intrepid, others nervous and\n",
      "easily agitated. Perhaps with stricter analogy we might compare them to\n",
      "human beings; for we find trees that represent the man of quiet and\n",
      "dignified deportment, also the man of excited manners and rapid\n",
      "gesticulations. Some trees, like the fir, having stiff branches and\n",
      "foliage, move awkwardly backward and forward in the wind, without any\n",
      "separate motions of their leaves. While we admire the symmetrical and\n",
      "stately forms of such trees, we are reminded of men who present a noble\n",
      "personal appearance, accompanied with ungainly manners.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some trees, having stiff branches with flexible leaves, do not bend to a\n",
      "moderate breeze, but their foliage readily yields to the motion of the\n",
      "wind. This habit is observed in the oak and the ash, in all trees that\n",
      "have a pendulous foliage and upright or horizontal branches. The poplars\n",
      "possess this habit in a remarkable degree, and it is proverbial in the\n",
      "aspen. It is also conspicuous in the common pear-tree and in the small\n",
      "white birch. Other trees, like the American elm, wave their branches\n",
      "gracefully, with but little apparent motion of their leaves. We observe\n",
      "the same habit in the weeping willow, and indeed in all trees with a\n",
      "long and flexible spray. The wind produces by its action on these a\n",
      "general sweeping movement without any rustle. It is easy to observe,\n",
      "when walking in a grove, that the only graceful motions come from trees\n",
      "with drooping branches, because these alone are long and slender.\n",
      "\n",
      "The very rapid motion of the leaves of the aspen has given origin to\n",
      "some remarkable superstitions. The Highlanders of Scotland believe the\n",
      "wood of this tree to be that of which the holy cross was made, and that\n",
      "its leaves are consequently never allowed to rest. Impressed with the\n",
      "awfulness of the tragedy of the crucifixion, they are constantly\n",
      "indicating to the winds the terrors that agitate them. The small white\n",
      "birch displays considerable of the same motion of the leaves; but we\n",
      "take little notice of it, because they are softer and produce less of a\n",
      "rustling sound. The flickering lights and shadows observed when walking\n",
      "under these trees, on a bright noonday, have always been admired. All\n",
      "these habits awaken our interest in trees and other plants by\n",
      "assimilating them to animated things.\n",
      "\n",
      "Much of the beauty of the silver poplar comes from its glittering\n",
      "lights, when it presents the green upper surface of its foliage,\n",
      "alternating rapidly with the white silvery surface beneath. This we may\n",
      "readily perceive even in cloudy weather, but in the bright sunshine the\n",
      "contrasts are very brilliant. In all trees, however, we observe this\n",
      "glittering beauty of motion in the sunshine. The under part of leaves\n",
      "being less glossy than the upper part, there is in the assemblage the\n",
      "same tremulous lustre that appears on the rippled surface of a lake by\n",
      "moonlight.\n",
      "\n",
      "We observe occasionally other motions which I have not described, such\n",
      "as the uniform bending of the whole tree. In a strong current of wind,\n",
      "tall and slender trees especially attract our attention by bending over\n",
      "uniformly like a plume. This habit is often seen in the white birch, a\n",
      "tree that in its usual assemblages takes a plumelike form. When a whole\n",
      "grove of white birches is seen thus bending over in one direction from\n",
      "the action of a brisk wind, they seem like a procession of living forms.\n",
      "In a storm we watch with peculiar interest the bending forms of certain\n",
      "tall elms, such as we often see in clearings, with their heads bowed\n",
      "down almost to the ground by the force of the tempest. It is only the\n",
      "waves of the ocean and the tossing of its billows that can afford us so\n",
      "vivid an impression of the sublimity of a tempest as the violent swaying\n",
      "of a forest and the roaring of the winds among the lofty tree-tops.\n",
      "\n",
      "The motions of an assemblage of trees cannot be observed except from a\n",
      "stand that permits us to look down upon the surface formed by their\n",
      "summits. We should then perceive that pines and firs, with all the\n",
      "stiffness of their branches, display a great deal of undulating motion.\n",
      "These undulations or wavy movements are particularly graceful in a grove\n",
      "of hemlocks, when they are densely assembled without being crowded. It\n",
      "is remarkable that one of the most graceful of trees belongs to a family\n",
      "which are distinguished by their stiffness and formality. The hemlock,\n",
      "unlike other firs and spruces, has a very flexible spray, with leaves\n",
      "also slightly movable, which are constantly sparkling when agitated by\n",
      "the wind. If we look down from an opposite point, considerably elevated,\n",
      "upon a grove of hemlocks when they are exposed to brisk currents of\n",
      "wind, they display a peculiar undulating movement of the branches and\n",
      "foliage, made more apparent by the glitter of their leaves.\n",
      "\n",
      "The surface of any assemblage of trees when in motion bears a close\n",
      "resemblance to the waves of the sea. But hemlocks represent its\n",
      "undulations when greatly agitated, without any broken lines upon its\n",
      "surface. Other firs display in their motions harsher angles and a\n",
      "somewhat broken surface of the waves. We see the tops of these trees and\n",
      "their extreme branches awkwardly swaying backwards and forwards, and\n",
      "forming a surface like that of the sea when it is broken by tumultuous\n",
      "waves of a moderate height. The one suggests the idea of tumult and\n",

      "true by experiments in vital chemistry. The same chemical appropriation\n",
      "of gases and transpiration of oxygen is performed by all classes of\n",
      "vegetables; but any work in the economy of nature assigned to vegetation\n",
      "is the most effectually accomplished by trees. The property of foliage\n",
      "that requires carbonic-acid gas for its breathing purposes, and causes\n",
      "it to give out oxygen, is of vital importance; and it is hardly to be\n",
      "doubted that a close room well lighted by the sun would sustain its\n",

      "leaf, but not in flower, and occupied by breathing animals, than if the\n",
      "animals occupied it without the plants.\n",

      "herbs in which no chemical process is involved,â€”that of exhaling\n",
      "moisture into the atmosphere after it has been absorbed by the roots.\n",
      "Hence the humidity of this element is greatly dependent on foliage. A\n",
      "few simple experiments will show how much more rapidly and abundantly\n",
      "this evaporation takes place when the soil is covered with growing\n",
      "plants than when the surface is bare. Take two teacups of equal size and\n",
      "fill them with water. Place them on a table, and insert into one of them\n",
      "cuttings of growing plants with their leaves, and let the other stand\n",
      "with water only. In a few hours the water will disappear from the cup\n",
      "containing the plants, while that in the other cup will not be sensibly\n",
      "diminished. Indeed, there is reason to believe that gallons of water\n",
      "might be evaporated into the air by keeping the cup containing the\n",
      "cuttings always full, before the single gill contained in the other cup\n",
      "would disappear. If a few cuttings will evaporate a half-pint of water\n",
      "in twelve hours, we can imagine the vast quantity constantly exhaled\n",
      "into the atmosphere by a single tree. The largest steam-boiler in use,\n",
      "kept constantly boiling, would not probably evaporate more water than\n",
      "one large elm in the same time.\n",
      "\n",
      "We may judge, from our experiment with the cuttings, that a vastly\n",
      "greater proportion of moisture would be exhaled into the atmosphere from\n",
      "any given surface of ground when covered with vegetation, than from the\n",
      "same amount of uncovered surface, or even of standing water. Plants are\n",
      "indeed the most important existing agents of nature for conveying the\n",
      "moisture of the earth into the air. The quantity of transpiring foliage\n",

      "The flowering of the forest is the conclusion of the beautiful phenomena\n",

      "obliquely toward us. All foliage is more or less transparent, and the\n",

      "viewed in this manner, and all the tiresome uniformity of summer verdure\n",

      "The Oak surpasses all other trees, not only in actual strength, but also\n",
      "in that outward appearance by which this quality is manifested. This\n",
      "expression is owing to the general horizontal tendency of its principal\n",
      "boughs, the great angularity of the unions of its smaller branches, the\n",
      "want of flexibility in its spray, and its great size compared with its\n",
      "height, all manifesting power to resist the wind and the storm. Hence it\n",
      "is called the monarch of trees, surpassing all in the qualities of\n",
      "nobleness and capacity. It is the embodiment of strength, dignity, and\n",
      "grandeur. The severest hurricane cannot overthrow it, and, by destroying\n",
      "some of its principal branches, leaves it only with more wonderful proof\n",
      "of its resistance. Like a rock in mid-ocean, it becomes in old age a\n",
      "just symbol of fortitude, parting with its limbs one by one, as they are\n",
      "withered by decay or broken by the gale, but still retaining its\n",
      "many-centuried existence, when, like an old patriarch, it has seen all\n",

      "A remarkable habit of the Oak is that of putting forth its lower\n",
      "branches at a wide angle from the central shaft, which rapidly\n",
      "diminishes in size, but does not entirely disappear above the lower\n",
      "junction. No other tree displays more irregularities in its\n",

      "has also a more abundant undergrowth than many other woods, because it\n",

      "only be traced among its subordinate branches by the most careful\n",

      "general opinion that certain trees are exempt from the stroke of\n",
      "lightning is very ancient. It probably originated in some religious\n",
      "ideas of their sanctity, and men in more enlightened times have\n",
      "endeavored to explain it by philosophy, instead of rejecting it as\n",
      "fable. It was affirmed by Hugh Maxwell, an American writer, that\n",
      "lightning often strikes the elm, the chestnut, the oak, the pine, and\n",
      "less frequently the ash; but it always evades the beech, the birch, and\n",
      "the maple. Captain Dibdin remarks, in a letter to Alexander Wilson, that\n",
      "in the forests of Virginia the pines, though taller than the oaks, were\n",
      "less frequently injured by lightning, and considers them pretty secure\n",
      "when growing among oaks. These accounts by different writers are too\n",
      "various and contradictory to be of much value in aiding us to discover\n",
      "the truth. It is probable that the partial exemption of certain trees\n",
      "from the stroke of lightning, if any such accounts be true, depends on\n",
      "their size and shape. A tall tree in an assemblage would be more exposed\n",
      "than the others. It may also be supposed that if a tree has a regular\n",
      "ramification, smooth and straight branches and trunk, it is better\n",
      "formed for a conductor, and that it would be more liable to receive a\n",
      "charge of the fluid. But all these opinions are probably of the same\n",
      "character with those respecting the antipathy of serpents for certain\n",
      "trees,â€”traditionary notions which are hardly worthy of investigation.\n",
      "The opinion of the ancients concerning the immunity of the laurel was\n",
      "probably derived from their idea of its sanctity as the tree which was\n",
      "dedicated to Apollo. At the present day there exists in Italy a similar\n",
      "notion concerning the white grapevine. Some of the peasantry of that\n",
      "country are accustomed to twining its branches around the head and waist\n",
      "as a protection from a thunder-stroke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trees are generally believed to protect a house adjoining them from\n",
      "lightning; on the contrary, it is known that men and animals seeking\n",
      "refuge under a tree in an open plain are in greater danger than outside\n",
      "of it. The lightning is therefore probably conducted by the water\n",
      "passing down on the surface of the branches and trunk; for if the tree\n",
      "itself were the conductor, the lightning would pass through the trunk\n",
      "into the ground, and, like a lightning-rod, act as a protection to\n",
      "objects near, but not in contact with it. Dr. Franklin thought the\n",
      "safest place a few yards distant from a tree, and a little outside of\n",
      "its widest spread. It is unsafe to stand under the drip of a tree, which\n",
      "might convey to the person an electric charge. It was the opinion of M.\n",
      "Arago, that trees overtopping houses at small distances cannot be\n",
      "regarded as affording sure protection, like a properly adjusted\n",
      "lightning-rod; but he admitted that when a storm passes over a forest it\n",
      "is decidedly enfeebled. The forest certainly diminishes the power of a\n",
      "thunderbolt. The security derived from trees attaches principally to\n",
      "large assemblages. Though a house may receive but little protection from\n",

      "matting of leaves that covers the ground under a beechen wood prevents\n",

      "leaf-buds, resembling so many little spears. The terminal branches,\n",
      "forming the spray, are very numerous and slender, and remarkably\n",
      "beautiful. The Beech, when in full leaf, is seen to the best advantage\n",

      "darker color and firmer texture. The aments of the Hickory are in\n",

      "The Hickory rises to a greater proportional height, with less length and\n",
      "spread of the branches, the lower ones being higher from the root of the\n",
      "tree and smaller than those of the walnut. Many of the trees are\n",
      "flattened at the top, and take a cylindrical form, when they approach to\n",

      "displaying frequent gaps, and presenting several distinct masses of\n",
      "foliage.\n",

      "The Hickory, therefore, when full-grown, has seldom much elegance, and\n",
      "little of the beauty of grace and symmetry. Its picturesque qualities\n",
      "are its sturdy habit, its great height, its dense and dark green\n",
      "foliage, its approach to a cylindrical shape, and its general\n",
      "eccentricity of growth. I have never seen a Hickory with long spreading\n",
      "branches like those of the butternut, nor with neat and prim foliage\n",
      "like that of the ash. The different species are so common in all the\n",

      "fortunate circumstance for thousands of beautiful and valuable trees,\n",

      "irregularity of outline which are generally regarded as picturesque\n",
      "qualities. I see, while I am writing, directly before my window, a tall\n",
      "Hickory, standing on an elevation that makes the sky its only\n",
      "background. It is tall and narrow in its shape, and its head is divided\n",

      "Not long since, in one of my rambles in Essex County, Massachusetts,\n",
      "which is one of the most open and cultivated sections of the country, I\n",
      "entered a little valley near the sea, comprising about fifty acres of\n",
      "well-cultivated land, surrounded by a sort of amphitheatre of hills,\n",
      "which were covered with a dense forest of pines and firs. It was\n",
      "occupied by an intelligent farmer, whose careful observation had taken\n",
      "note of many things which are overlooked by the generality of his class.\n",
      "He remarked that his seed-time and harvest were several days earlier\n",
      "than on the farms in the open country, and that he had crocuses and\n",
      "tulips in his garden, on the south side of the surrounding wood, so\n",
      "early as to astonish his neighbors in the outer world. In regard to the\n",
      "relative temperature of the woods and of the open plain in summer, he\n",
      "remarked that it varied according to the time of day or night. The woods\n",
      "were cooler than the open country, in clear, calm weather, from about\n",
      "nine oâ€™clock in the morning until near noonday; after this time the heat\n",
      "in them increased more rapidly than in the open country, and at the time\n",
      "of dew-fall it was greater in the woods, and continued so during the\n",
      "early part of the night. If the sky were cloudy, not much difference\n",
      "could be perceived at any hour in the temperature of the two situations.\n",
      "In cold and windy weather the woods afforded a comfortable shelter, and\n",
      "this shelter made them apparently warmer, even when the thermometer\n",
      "would indicate no difference.\n",

      "The theory of my rustic friend contains the general results of all that\n",
      "science has yet discovered in relation to the temperature of woods. But\n",
      "the effects of clearing the forest are so different in different\n",
      "situations as to have given origin to a multitude of theories. This\n",
      "diversity of opinion, however, comes from a partial observation of\n",
      "facts, without their qualifying circumstances. On a hot summerâ€™s day we\n",
      "sprinkle our floors with water, for the purpose of cooling the air of\n",
      "the room. But how can it produce this effect, when by evaporation it\n",
      "carries heat from the floor into the very air that is cooled by it? The\n",
      "fact is easily explained. The greater coolness felt when the air of the\n",
      "room is saturated with the moisture evaporated from the sprinkled floor\n",
      "might not be exactly indicated by the thermometer. The sensation of\n",
      "coolness is caused by the increased power of the air to conduct the heat\n",
      "rapidly from our persons,â€”the effect of its greater humidity. By the\n",
      "same law we may explain why, after a few clear cold days in the winter,\n",
      "if a south-wind arises, we feel as if the cold were greater, because\n",
      "this wind, while it raises the temperature, charges the air with\n",
      "invisible moisture.\n",
      "\n",
      "The coldness of the atmosphere over grassy meadows when the sky is\n",
      "clear, after the decline of the sun in summer, is a matter of common\n",
      "observation. As this phenomenon is most evident on the clearest nights,\n",
      "it has given rise to the notion that the moon cools the night air. In\n",
      "our rambles after sunset, we have all felt these constant changes of\n",
      "temperature, which are remarkable when walking over an uneven road, the\n",
      "degree of heat corresponding nearly with our altitude. When we occupy\n",
      "high ground, the air is warm and dry; as soon as we descend into a\n",
      "valley, we feel a sudden chill. These differences are not observed on a\n",
      "cloudy night, or when a clear brisk wind is blowing. But in a calm state\n",
      "of the atmosphere, as the lowest stratum of air contains the greatest\n",
      "amount of moisture, its capacity for retaining heat is proportionally\n",
      "diminished. Consequently the heat from the ground is radiated with great\n",
      "rapidity through this damp stratum of air, while the higher strata\n",
      "remain unchanged in their temperature. Indeed, it has been found by\n",
      "experiment that while the greatest heat at noonday in calm summer\n",
      "weather is very near the surface of the ground, yet after dew-fall the\n",
      "highest temperature is several feet above this surface, increasing in\n",
      "altitude for some hours after sunset.\n",

      "escaped by radiation in the open plain. According to these laws of the\n",

      "\n",
      "I have spoken of trees as the purifiers and renovators of the\n",
      "atmosphere, as regulators of its humidity, equalizers of the electric\n",
      "fluid, and as safeguards against both drought and inundations; but I\n",

      "the actual creators, in many places, of the soil upon which they stand.\n",
      "The trees by means of their foliage are direct fertilizers of the ground\n",
      "they cover, causing it to increase in bulk as long as they stand upon\n",
      "it. But the leaves of trees are not the only source of this increase of\n",
      "bulk and fertility. The lichens and mosses, and various incrustations\n",
      "upon their bark, and the offal of birds, insects, and quadrupeds, all\n",
      "contribute to the same end. Hence the most barren situations will\n",
      "produce good crops for several years after the removal of their wood;\n",
      "and from these facts we may learn why a forest is still vigorous, though\n",
      "it has remained for centuries upon the same ground. If it were\n",
      "fertilized only by the decayed foliage of the trees, it would gradually\n",
      "lose its fitness to promote the health and growth of the timber. But the\n",
      "foreign matters I have enumerated, the decayed cryptogamous plants, and\n",
      "the relics and deposits of animals which have lived and died there,\n",
      "supply the soil with nitrogenous ingredients in which decomposed leaves\n",
      "are wanting.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what are the sources of all the matters which are furnished by the\n",
      "trees alone? They are chiefly the atmosphere and the deeper strata of\n",
      "the soil. The roots of the trees, penetrating to a considerable depth,\n",
      "draw up from the subsoil certain nutritive salts that enter into the\n",
      "substance of all parts of the tree. This is restored to the surface by\n",
      "every tree or branch that falls and moulders upon it, and the leaves\n",
      "increase its bulk still more by their annual decay. According to\n",
      "Vaupell, â€œthe carbonic acid given out by decaying leaves, when taken up\n",
      "by water, serves to dissolve the mineral constituents of the soil, and\n",
      "it is particularly active in disintegrating feldspar and the clay\n",
      "derived from its decomposition.â€ These facts explain why the surface\n",
      "soil in a forest may constantly increase in bulk, without communication\n",
      "with any foreign sources of supply.\n",
      "\n",
      "If a wood be situated in a valley or on a level plain, it retains all\n",

      "a part of the _dÃ©bris_ will be washed down by floods into the fields\n",
      "below. Hence, by preserving a growth of wood upon all barren slopes and\n",
      "elevations, the farmer derives benefit from it, both as a fertilizer and\n",
      "as a source of irrigation to the lower part of the slopes or the base of\n",

      "constantly oozing from the spongy bed of the wood, that cannot\n",

      "barren or steep, are unprofitable alike for tillage or pasture. They\n",
      "require more manure than other grounds, and more labor in its\n",
      "distribution. Hence, if divested of wood, as I have often repeated, they\n",
      "are almost useless; while, if densely wooded, they fertilize and\n",

      "their development that precedes their full expansion. After this period,\n",
      "as the landscape-painter well knows, all verdure is tarnished and rusty.\n",

      "colors are seen at the time when three fourths of the trees still remain\n",
      "unchanged. As one after another assumes its ruddy, golden and purple\n",
      "hues, the earlier and more brilliant drop their leaves; and some are\n",
      "entirely denuded, while others are fully covered with foliage and\n",
      "verdure. Even different individuals of the same species, of maples\n",
      "especially, manifest a great difference of habit in this respect, caused\n",
      "in some cases by the peculiarities of their situation. Trees in swamps\n",
      "and low grounds lose their leaves earlier than the occupants of a deep\n",

      "Some species are perfectly uniform in their colors. The poplar and\n",
      "birch, for example, are invariably yellow; the sumach and whortleberry\n",
      "are chiefly red; while the maples display as many colors as if they were\n",
      "of different species. But each individual tree shows nearly the same\n",
      "every year, as apple-trees bear fruit of the same tints from year to\n",
      "year. Two red maples growing side by side are seldom alike, and in a\n",
      "group of them you will see almost as many shades of color as trees. Some\n",
      "are entirely yellow, others scarlet, some crimson, purple, or orange,\n",
      "others variegated with several of these colors. There is more uniformity\n",
      "in the tints of the sugar maple. I have seen long rows of this species\n",
      "that were only yellow and orange, though its colors generally vary from\n",
      "orange to scarlet. Purple and crimson are confined chiefly to the red\n",
      "maple; I have seen in different individuals of this species all the hues\n",
      "that are ever displayed in the autumn woods. The red maples, more than\n",
      "all other trees combined, are the crowning glory of a New England\n",
      "autumn. The sugar maple, though more brilliant, has a narrower range of\n",
      "colors.\n",
      "\n",
      "As early as the last week in August, we perceive the tinting of a few\n",
      "red maples, which always exhibit the earliest change. Sometimes a\n",
      "solitary branch is tinted, while the remainder of the foliage is green,\n",
      "as if something affecting its vitality had prematurely colored it.\n",
      "Frequently the coloring process begins at the top; the purple crown of\n",
      "autumn is placed upon the green brow of summer, and we behold the two\n",
      "seasons represented at once in the same tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first coloration is usually seen at the veins of the leaf, extending\n",
      "outwardly until the whole is tinted. Sometimes it appears in spots, like\n",
      "drops of blood upon the green surface; and in this case the leaf usually\n",
      "remains spotted. In the foliage of trees that assume a variety of\n",
      "colors, yellows generally predominate in the interior of the mass, red\n",
      "and purple on the outside. In the red maple, and less frequently in the\n",
      "rock maple when in a protected situation, the leaves are often formally\n",
      "variegated with figures of yellow, red, green, and purple. Those of the\n",
      "poison sumach, the cornel, and the snowy mespilus, are sometimes\n",
      "beautifully striated with yellow or orange upon a darker ground; but I\n",
      "have searched the woods in vain to find any other than a maple-leaf\n",
      "configurated like a butterflyâ€™s wing.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the foliage of the tupelo deep shades of purple first appear,\n",
      "brightening into crimson or scarlet before it falls. This tree more\n",
      "invariably shows a mass of unmixed crimson than any other species. Even\n",
      "in the maple, if the general presentation is red, you will find a\n",
      "considerable mixture of yellow. The colors of the scarlet oak are seldom\n",
      "pure or unmixed; but those of the tupelo are invariable, except as they\n",
      "pass through the gradations from purple to scarlet. If, therefore, the\n",
      "tupelo were as common in the woods as the maple, it would contribute\n",
      "more splendor to the scenery of autumn. There are many trees that never\n",
      "produce a red leaf. I have never found one in the foliage of the poplar,\n",
      "the birch, the tulip, the hickory, or the chestnut, which are all of\n",
      "some shade of yellow; but there are usually a few yellow leaves\n",
      "scattered among the ruddy foliage of any tree that assumes this color.\n",
      "\n",
      "When all the circumstances attending the season have been favorable to\n",
      "the tints of autumn, there is no tree of the forest that would attract\n",
      "more admiration from the beautiful sobriety of its colors than the\n",
      "American ash. But this tree is so easily affected by drought, that after\n",
      "a dry summer its leaves fall prematurely and its tints are imperfect.\n",
      "The colors of the ash are quite unique, and distinguish it from all\n",
      "other trees. Under favorable circumstances its coloring process is\n",
      "nearly uniform. It begins with a general impurpling of the whole mass of\n",
      "foliage nearly at the same time, and its gradual changes remind me of\n",
      "those observed in sea-mosses during the process of bleaching. There is\n",
      "an invariable succession in these tints, as in the brightening beams of\n",
      "morn. They are first of a dark bronze, turning from this to a chocolate,\n",
      "then to a violet brown, and finally to a salmon-color, or yellow with a\n",
      "slight shade of lilac. When the leaves are faded nearly yellow, they are\n",
      "ready to drop from the tree. It is remarkable, that, with all this\n",
      "variety of hues, neither crimson nor any shade of scarlet is ever seen\n",
      "in the ash. It ought to be remembered that the gradations of autumn\n",
      "tints in all cases are in the order of those of sunrise, from dark to\n",
      "lighter hues, and never the reverse. I make no reference to the browns\n",
      "of dead leaves, which are darker than yellow or orange, from which they\n",
      "turn. I speak only of the changes of leaves before they are seared or\n",
      "dry.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the middle of October, the oaks are the most conspicuous ornaments\n",
      "of the forest; but they are seldom brilliant. In their foliage there is\n",
      "a predominance of what we call leather-colors, with a considerable\n",
      "mixture of certain shades of red that are peculiar to the oak. We rarely\n",
      "find pure yellow or scarlet leaves in the foliage of any species of oak.\n",
      "The color of the scarlet oak is nearer a purple or crimson than any\n",
      "other shade of red. The white oak turns, with but little variation, to\n",
      "an ashen-purple or impure violet. The black and red oaks display varying\n",
      "and imperfect shades of drab and orange. The oaks are remarkable for the\n",
      "persistence of their foliage, and for the duration of their tints, which\n",
      "are chiefly the brown and russet of dead leaves with a lively polish.\n",
      "Long after other deciduous trees have become leafless, the various\n",
      "sombre shades of the different oaks cast a melancholy tinge over the\n",
      "waning beauty of the forest.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are wont to speak of trees as the principal objects of admiration in\n",
      "autumnal scenery, but the shrubs, though less conspicuous on account of\n",
      "their inferior size, are not less brilliant. It is also remarkable that\n",
      "reds predominate in the shrubbery, and yellows in the trees. Reds and\n",
      "purples distinguish the whortleberry, the cornel, the viburnum, and the\n",
      "sumach, including all their species. There is indeed so small a\n",
      "proportion of yellow in the shrubbery, that it is hardly distinguishable\n",
      "in the general mass of scarlet, crimson, and purple. Among trees, on the\n",
      "contrary, yellows prevail in all miscellaneous woods. They distinguish\n",
      "the poplar, the birch, the hickory, the tulip-tree, the elm, and a good\n",
      "proportion of the maples. It ought to be remarked, however, that there\n",
      "are more shrubs than trees that do not change materially, but remain\n",
      "green until the fall of their leaves. The alder remains green; and as it\n",
      "covers a large proportion of our wet grounds, it might seem to an\n",
      "observer in those situations that the tints of autumn were confined to\n",
      "the trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many persons still believe frost to be the great limner of the foliage,\n",
      "as if it were a sort of dyeing material. On the contrary, the slightest\n",
      "frost will destroy the tints of every leaf that is touched by it. It is\n",
      "not uncommon to witness a general tarnishing of the autumnal tints by\n",
      "frost as early as September. In some years they are spoiled by it before\n",
      "they have begun to be developed. An autumn rarely passes when the colors\n",
      "of the foliage are not half ruined before the time when they ought to be\n",
      "in their brightest condition. But the injury they receive from slight\n",
      "frosts is not apparent to careless observation. In the meridian of their\n",
      "beauty, heat will damage the tints as badly as frost. A very hot and\n",
      "sunny day occurring the first or second week of October makes almost as\n",
      "much havoc with the ash and the maple as a freezing night, fading their\n",
      "leaves rapidly and loosening their attachment to the branches, so that\n",
      "the slightest wind will scatter them to the ground. Yet the action of\n",
      "heat differs materially from that of frost. Frost imbrowns and crisps or\n",
      "sears the leaves, while heat only fades them to lighter and more\n",
      "indefinite shades. Frost is destructive of their colors, heat is only a\n",
      "bleaching agent. Cool weather in autumn without frost is necessary for\n",
      "the preservation of its seasonal beauty.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most brilliant autumnal hues appear after a wet summer, followed by\n",
      "a cool autumn, unattended with frost. Cool weather preserves not only\n",
      "the purity of the colors, but also the persistence of the foliage. If\n",
      "the early frosts are delayed, the tints are brighter for this delay\n",
      "while the weather remains cool. But a wet summer is so generally\n",
      "followed by premature cold, that the finest displays of autumn scenery\n",
      "are often suddenly ruined by a hard frost. Seldom are all the favorable\n",
      "circumstances for preserving the purity of the tints combined in any one\n",
      "season. Not more than once in six or eight years are both heat and frost\n",
      "kept away so as to permit the leaves to pass, unseared and untarnished,\n",
      "through all their beautiful gradations of color.\n",

      "There are several herbaceous plants that display tints similar to those\n",
      "of the woods; but they are not very conspicuous. I must not fail to\n",

      "of form, having neither leaves nor any very discernible flowers, which\n",

      "which the celebrated Wourali poison is made by the natives of Guiana.\n",
      "The poisonous properties of the sap are said to be dissipated by\n",

      "being exposed to its fumes, when its branches are burned with other\n",
      "brush.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Poison Sumach is a very elegant shrub. It is prim and slender, and\n",
      "draws attention by its want of resemblance to other trees and shrubs in\n",
      "our woods. The main stems and principal branches are of an ashen-gray\n",
      "color, though the recent shoots, before they harden into wood, and the\n",
      "leaf-stems are of a fine crimson or purple. The leaves are beautifully\n",
      "pinnate, of a light green hue with purple veins. The flowers and fruit\n",

      "it, breathe its burning fumes, and even chew its leaves and branches\n",
      "with impunity. Some are rendered more susceptible by having been once\n",
      "poisoned; others, who were often injuriously affected by it in their\n",

      "suffered by individuals from other plants. I am acquainted with a lady\n",

      "tremulous habit of the foliage, but is never assembled in large forest\n",
      "groups. Like the alder, it is employed by Nature for the shading of her\n",

      "their nest, feed their offspring upon larvÃ¦, which they collect from the\n",
      "nearest ground that affords them a supply. Hence I consider that bare\n",
      "rock, with its trees and shrubbery, the most profitable division of my\n",
      "farm, from the shelter it affords the birds, which are in an important\n",

      "\n",
      "I have often thought of my neighborâ€™s remarks, especially when I have\n",
      "observed the diligence of our farmers in destroying upon their grounds\n",
      "every acceptable harbor for the birds. When we are traversing a wood, if\n",
      "we discover an apple-tree growing in a little clearing or open space, we\n",
      "find it invariably exempt from the ravages of the common apple-borer.\n",
      "The same exemption is observed in those fruit-trees that stand very near\n",
      "a wild wood, or any wood containing a spontaneous undergrowth. The\n",
      "explanation of this fact is that the wood affords a harbor to the birds\n",
      "that destroy these insects in all their forms. Orchards and gardens, on\n",
      "the contrary, which are located at any considerable distance from a\n",
      "wood, have not this security. Robins, it is true, are very abundant in\n",
      "orchards, which are their breeding-places; but robins, though the most\n",
      "useful birds that are known to exist, take all their food from the\n",
      "ground. They destroy vast quantities of cutworms and chrysalids buried\n",
      "in the soil, but they take no part of their insect food from the trees.\n",
      "The birds that perform this work are the sylvias, woodpeckers, creepers,\n",
      "and other species that live only in woods and thickets. Hence an orchard\n",
      "that is nearly surrounded by a wild wood of much extent is not badly\n",
      "infested by borers and other injurious insects.\n",
      "\n",
      "All species of insects multiply in cultivated grounds, while the birds,\n",
      "with a few exceptions, that feed upon them, can find a nursery and\n",
      "protection only in the woods. â€œThe locust,â€ says George P. Marsh, â€œwhich\n",
      "ravages the East with its voracious armies, is bred in vast open plains,\n",
      "which admit the full heat of the sun to hasten the hatching of the eggs,\n",
      "gather no moisture to destroy them, _and harbor no bird to feed upon\n",
      "their larvÃ¦_. It is only since the felling of the forests of Asia Minor\n",
      "and Cyrene that the locust has become so fearfully destructive in those\n",
      "countries; and the grasshopper, which now threatens to be almost as\n",
      "great a pest to the agriculture of North American soils, breeds in\n",
      "seriously injurious numbers only where a wide extent of surface is bare\n",
      "of woods.â€\n",
      "\n",
      "Some men destroy trees and shrubbery in their borders, because they are\n",
      "supposed to harbor insects. But if this be true, it is because they are\n",
      "not sufficient in extent to shelter the birds that feed upon them. The\n",
      "insects that multiply upon our lands deposit their eggs some in the\n",
      "soil, some on the branches of trees and upon fences and buildings. They\n",
      "are nowise dependent on a wild growth of wood and shrubbery. These pests\n",
      "of agriculture need nothing better than the under edge of a clapboard or\n",
      "a shingle whereon to suspend their cocoons or lay their eggs. So minute\n",
      "are the objects that will afford them all the conveniences they need,\n",
      "when hatching and when passing through all their transformations, till\n",
      "they become perfect insects, that no artifice or industry of man can\n",
      "deprive them of their nurseries, or appreciably lessen their numbers.\n",
      "All inventions and appliances used to rid the trees and grounds of these\n",
      "pests never destroyed more than one in a million of their whole number.\n",
      "It is not in the power of man, with all his science, unassisted by\n",
      "birds, to prevent the multiplication of insects from being the cause of\n",
      "his own annihilation. But the farmer, when he destroys the border\n",
      "shrubbery in his fields and the coppice and wood on his hills,\n",
      "exterminates the birds by hosts, while the mischievous boy with his gun\n",
      "destroys only a few individuals. The clipped hedge-row, which is often\n",
      "substituted for a border of wild shrubbery, may assist in breeding\n",
      "insects; but the birds never build their nests in a hedge-row, unless it\n",
      "be a long-neglected one.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have in another essay spoken of the scarcity of birds and other\n",
      "animals in the primitive forest. They are not numerous there, because\n",
      "the forest would yield them only a scanty subsistence. The forest border\n",
      "is their nursery and their shelter, but their best feeding-places are\n",
      "the cultivated grounds. There is not a single species whose means of\n",
      "subsistence are not increased by the clearing of the forest and the\n",
      "cultivation of the land; but they require a certain proportion of wild\n",
      "wood for their habitation. Very few species build their nests in the\n",
      "trees and shrubbery of our gardens, unless they are near a wood. In that\n",
      "case the catbird often nestles in the garden, that during the rearing of\n",
      "its young it may be near the grounds that produce larvÃ¦. Most of the\n",
      "woodpeckers, the sylvias, and the small thrushes, including some of our\n",
      "most valuable birds, cannot rear their young except in a wild wood. Yet\n",
      "all these, solitary as they are in their habits, increase under\n",
      "favorable circumstances with the multiplication of insects consequent\n",
      "upon the culture of the soil. It may be affirmed as an indisputable\n",
      "truth, that if their increase were not checked by the sporting habits of\n",
      "men and boys, and the clearing and grubbing habits of â€œmodel farmers,â€\n",
      "birds of every species would increase in the same ratio with the\n",

      "It has been observed that a meadow covered with luxuriant grass and\n",

      "than a similar meadow covered with a scanty herbage. The moisture\n",
      "exhaled into the air by vegetable perspiration is greater than from any\n",
      "other natural surface; and as the radiation of heat is rapid in\n",
      "proportion to the moist condition of the atmosphere, the cooling process\n",
      "over a grassy meadow is vastly greater than over a similar ground bare\n",
      "of vegetation. A wood, in like manner, by exhaling through its foliage\n",
      "the moisture it draws from the earth, cools the atmosphere in proportion\n",
      "to the amount of its foliage, while at the same time it shades the\n",
      "ground from the sun. Anything that should check this vegetable\n",
      "perspiration would in the same ratio preserve the heat of the atmosphere\n",
      "by diminishing the radiation of heat that takes place more slowly in dry\n",
      "than in moist air.\n",

      "evaporation caused by the drying of fallen leaves and herbage is\n",

      "The atmosphere being dry, and the radiation of heat proportionally small\n",
      "in quantity, all these circumstances, if no unusual atmospheric\n",

      "sudden and universal accumulation of heat. The warm period that follows\n",

      "\n",
      "A writer in â€œSillimanâ€™s Journalâ€ of 1833, who advances a very different\n",
      "theory to explain this phenomenon, makes a statement that favors my\n",
      "view: â€œIt appears to us that the existence and duration of the Indian\n",
      "Summer in this country has an important connection with the extensive\n",
      "forests and uncultivated lands peculiar to America. And it is worthy of\n",
      "remark, that, according to the recollection of the oldest of our\n",
      "inhabitants, its former duration was often three or four weeks; whereas\n",
      "its present continuance is short and uncertain, seldom exceeding ten or\n",
      "fifteen days. It appears also that this decline has been somewhat\n",
      "regular, keeping pace with, and evidently influenced by, the gradual\n",
      "uncovering of the country.â€\n",

      "It is surprising that the writer, after making these observations,\n",
      "should resort to some unintelligible reasoning about the trade-winds,\n",
      "and certain assumed electric phenomena, to account for the Indian\n",
      "Summer. I can easily believe that before the encroachments upon the\n",
      "American forest were very extensive, this halcyon period of autumn may\n",
      "have occurred every year with great regularity. But since the clearing\n",
      "is almost universal, these conditions have been entirely changed. During\n",
      "the primitive state of the forest, its sudden denudation produced a more\n",
      "complete revolution on the face of the country than could possibly\n",
      "happen at the present time. The clearing of the woods has also cast down\n",
      "the barriers that impeded the circulation of the winds; at present these\n",
      "winds, sweeping freely over the continent, would counteract any\n",
      "influences, whatever they might be, that would produce an Indian Summer\n",
      "in any locality.\n",
      "\n",
      "The true Indian Summer was a period of very mild weather, lasting from\n",
      "ten to fifteen days, and accompanied neither by wind nor rain. It has\n",
      "been incorrectly described by certain writers as attended with fog. The\n",
      "sky, though somewhat dim, was not obscured by vapor, but by a sort of\n",
      "ruddy haze, that veiled the prospect, as it often will during a series\n",
      "of warm, still days happening at any season. I draw my inferences from\n",
      "what I have reason to consider the most authentic accounts. The air was\n",
      "dry; and it could not have been otherwise. If it were moist, the\n",
      "increased radiation would soon dissipate the heat and put an end to the\n",
      "Indian Summer, which was never known to survive a copious and extensive\n",
      "fall of rain. The atmosphere was described as being obscured by smoke,\n",
      "rather than vapor, and this was most apparent in the latter part of the\n",
      "day. This smoky atmosphere has led some writers to suppose the whole\n",
      "phenomenon to be caused by fires in the woods.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to tradition, no part of the year was more delightful than\n",
      "this short period. Those accounts, however, that extended its duration\n",
      "beyond the space of fourteen or fifteen days were undoubtedly\n",
      "exaggerated. The nearest approaches to an Indian Summer which I have\n",
      "witnessed in its proper season have never lasted a week. In our day,\n",
      "when a warm week occurs in the autumn, it comes at no regular or\n",
      "expected time. This irregularity of its occurrence proves that it is not\n",
      "to be identified as the Indian Summer, which was regular in its\n",
      "happening immediately after the entire denudation of the forest. Similar\n",
      "but shorter periods of mild and serene weather may happen, at the\n",
      "present epoch, in winter and spring as well as in autumn. These\n",
      "irregularities of the weather cannot be explained; nor can we make\n",
      "predictions of the time when any of them may happen. But a warm period\n",

      "â€œThe earliest chant,â€ says Momsen, â€œin the view of the Romans, was that\n",
      "which the trees sang to themselves, in the green solitudes of the\n",
      "forest. The whisperings and pipings of the _favorable spirit_ in the\n",
      "grove were repeated by the singer, with the accompaniment of the pipe.â€\n",
      "Certain trees belonging to the sacred groves gave oracular sounds, which\n",
      "were interpreted by musicians, and received by all men with faith and\n",
      "reverence. From the earliest ages men have listened to sounds from trees\n",
      "as music and as the voice of some deity, affording auguries of future\n",
      "events; for, as they reasoned, if a deity speaks to us, what sounds\n",
      "would be a more appropriate medium of communication than those of the\n",
      "trees which formed their temples and their altars? The sanctity\n",
      "attributed to certain groves by the ancients was probably owing to some\n",
      "peculiar sounds emitted by the trees, no less than to the grandeur and\n",
      "impressiveness of their assemblages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every tree, when swept by the winds, gives a sound in harmony with the\n",
      "character of its leaves and spray. The sounds from the lofty branches of\n",
      "firs and pines remind the listener of the murmuring of waters, and\n",
      "inspire the most agreeable sensations. How often have I sat under the\n",
      "shade of a pine wood, and listened to the fancied roaring of the distant\n",
      "waves of the sea, as the winds passed through their foliage. When the\n",
      "breeze commences, we hear the first soft rippling of the waves; as it\n",
      "increases, succeeding waves of fuller swell flow tremulously upon the\n",
      "strand, and as the wind subsides melt into silence as they recede from\n",
      "the shore. Other trees produce very different sounds. The colors of\n",
      "their leaves, and the glittering lights from their more or less\n",
      "refractive surfaces, do not differ more than the modifications of sound\n",
      "drawn from them by the passing winds. Every tree is a delicate musical\n",
      "instrument, that reminds us of the character of the tree and the season\n",

      "The sounds from trees are a very important part of the music of nature;\n",

      "produce feelings awakened by no other situation. It is in the deep\n",
      "stillness of the forest, and over spacious and uninhabited plains, that\n",

      "From the earliest period of history, mankind have looked upon trees and\n",
      "woods with veneration, regarding them as special gifts of the gods to\n",
      "the human race. The ancient priests and philosophers used them as their\n",
      "places of retirement, both for the study of wisdom and the services of\n",
      "religion. Hence arose that early custom of planting trees in circles,\n",
      "forming a kind of amphitheatre, for religious assemblies. The teachers\n",
      "of philosophy used the same circular groves. These were held in the\n",
      "greatest reverence; and no man dared to commit the sacrilegious act of\n",
      "cutting down any part of them or defacing any of the trees. By means of\n",
      "these circular groves, wise and holy men obtained that seclusion and\n",
      "quiet which it was not easy to find in towns and cities. They were both\n",
      "schools and chapels, devoted to religion and philosophy. Hence the\n",
      "often-quoted remark of Pliny that â€œthe groves were the first temples of\n",
      "the gods.â€\n",

      "It is not improbable that many of the ancient superstitions relating to\n",
      "trees and groves originated with wise men, who believed that such holy\n",
      "fears alone would restrain the people from devastating the whole earth\n",
      "by the destruction of trees. Science now supplies mankind with rational\n",
      "motives for their preservation, in place of the religious scruples of\n",

      "including even invading armies, whose chiefs, while respecting neither\n",
      "the lives nor the property of the enemy, held these consecrated groves\n",
      "sacred and inviolable. Hunting was forbidden within them by this\n",

      "of whiteness, relieved only by the dark slender lines of fences and the\n",
      "broader stripes of roads and lanes winding over the face of the snow,\n",
      "interspersed with buildings and occasional woods and thickets. It is\n",
      "apparent, however, that snow increases the variety of the landscape,\n",
      "when it is mapped out with groves and fragments of forest, resembling\n",
      "wooded islets rising out of a white sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "The charm of winter scenery is greatly heightened by the clearing of the\n",
      "forest, which hides the surface of the snow and causes the scene to wear\n",
      "less of the aspect of grandeur than of desolation. Grandeur\n",
      "characterizes the view wherever an almost uninterrupted expanse of some\n",
      "miles of surface is completely whitened with snow. The buoyancy we feel\n",
      "when rambling over such a landscape resembles that produced by great\n",
      "altitude. Our greater physical vigor in clear winter weather prepares us\n",
      "to be agreeably affected by surrounding views, because our thoughts are\n",
      "not diverted by any sense of uncomfortable exertion, as in the languid\n",
      "heat of summer. Our constant transition from valley to open plain, from\n",
      "plain to hill, and from hill to wood, keeps the mind constantly amused\n",
      "with new views. We are also inspired by the grandeur of the whole scene,\n",
      "and do not, as in summer, give ourselves up to voluptuous sensations,\n",
      "but to enjoyments more purely intellectual.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our attention is not so often directed to the beauty of trees in their\n",
      "denuded state, as when they are dressed in foliage and adorned with\n",
      "flowers and fruit. But when we consider that for six months of the year\n",
      "all the deciduous trees, constituting the greater part of the woods, are\n",
      "leafless, we cannot regard their appearance at this time as an\n",
      "unimportant study. When trees are in leaf their primary qualities as\n",
      "objects in landscape are apparent; but many secondary points of beauty\n",
      "are almost entirely hidden under this mass of foliage. In winter, when\n",
      "the whole frame of the tree is exposed to view, the delicate sculpture,\n",
      "the forms, the angles, and the divergences of their branches, present to\n",
      "sight an infinite variety of picturesque appearances.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are certain trees, however, which are almost ugly in winter,\n",
      "though very beautiful in their summer dress. We see nothing attractive\n",
      "in the horse-chestnut, the sumach, the catalpa, and the ash, in their\n",
      "denuded state, when the coarseness and deformity of their spray become\n",
      "their salient points. Of these the horse-chestnut and the catalpa are\n",
      "not surpassed in beauty when they are in flower, nor the sumach in its\n",
      "autumnal dress, nor the ash either in summer or autumn. There is as\n",
      "great a variety in the style of the frame and framework of different\n",
      "trees as in the forms and colors of their leaves and flowers. Indeed, in\n",
      "some respects, trees are a more interesting study in their denuded state\n",
      "than when dressed in foliage. In this condition single trees become more\n",
      "special objects of attention than assemblages. Yet it is in winter that\n",
      "we perceive to the best advantage the characters of a forest vista. As\n",
      "we pass under the interlacing branches of the trees, we observe that\n",
      "peculiar arch formed by the meeting and contact of those on opposite\n",
      "sides of an avenue. We see this appearance only in a wide avenue, where\n",
      "the trees have grown since it was laid out. In the pathless wood, or in\n",
      "a path made through the forest after the trees have attained maturity,\n",
      "they have no well-formed lateral branches, and display above our heads\n",
      "only a formless canopy.\n",
      "\n",
      "We may observe in the spray of different trees an invariable\n",
      "correspondence with some of their other characters. Nut-bearers, for\n",
      "example, have a coarser spray than small seed-bearers; trees with large\n",
      "or compound leaves, than those with small or simple foliage; and trees\n",
      "with opposite, than those with alternate branches. Hence the oak and the\n",
      "hickory have a coarser spray than the birch and the elm, and the\n",
      "large-leaved poplar than the slender-leaved willow; the ash, with\n",
      "compound leaves, than the maple with simple leaves, though both have\n",
      "opposite branches. But if a tree bears a large nut, with leaves compound\n",
      "and branches opposite, like the horse-chestnut, it has no spray at all.\n",
      "The beech-tree, however, having a very small nut, has a fine and elegant\n",
      "spray, not surpassed by any tree of the forest. The opposite character\n",
      "of the smaller branches of certain trees is never continued in the\n",
      "larger divisions. But the angularity of the boughs of the oak is\n",
      "repeated in its angular spray, and the gracefulness of the principal\n",
      "branches of the elm, the birch, and the lime is traced through all their\n",
      "minute subdivisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "All these phenomena are interesting subjects of observation in winter\n",
      "wood-scenery. But the geometric beauty of the spray of trees is hardly\n",
      "less remarkable than its different colors. A maple wood, for example, is\n",
      "gray; a poplar wood is greenish olive; a wood consisting chiefly of\n",
      "limes, black birches, and cherry-trees has a dark shade. These\n",
      "differences of coloring, as seen in masses, when viewing the wood from\n",
      "an elevated stand, often excite the surprise of spectators; for it is\n",
      "only the most careful observers who have noticed this variety of shades.\n",
      "In many assemblages of wood that consist of an evenly promiscuous\n",
      "combination of species, we observe no such picturesque marks of\n",
      "distinction. But in all unique assemblages, of which our land affords\n",
      "very frequent examples, the differences between a maple, a poplar, a\n",
      "willow, and a lime grove are respectively very striking. The study of\n",
      "these shades is of considerable importance to the painter who should\n",
      "wish to give a true representation of a winter landscape, with reference\n",
      "chiefly to its wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of my most delightful wood rambles have been taken in the winter,\n",
      "which has always seemed to me less a season of melancholy than autumn.\n",
      "The sadness we feel while the leaves are falling around us and the light\n",
      "of noon seems but an ominous twilight passes away after these changes\n",
      "are completed; we resume our cheerfulness, and look forward in pleasant\n",
      "anticipation of spring. I have never allowed the winter to interfere\n",
      "with my rambling, save when the cold was intense, the weather wet or\n",
      "stormy, or the snow too deep for pedestrian excursions. These\n",
      "difficulties are seldom in the way for more than a fourth part of the\n",
      "season. When the snow has been hardened by repeated freezing and thawing\n",
      "so as to bear our footsteps, or when the ground is bare, a winter walk\n",
      "affords positive pleasure. At such times I have often passed a day in\n",
      "the woods, not only to enjoy the physical pleasure of air and exercise\n",
      "and the sweet odors of the pines, but also to note the changes in the\n",
      "face of nature, and the manners and habits of the few remaining birds\n",
      "and quadrupeds.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most noted circumstances attending a winter ramble in the\n",
      "woods is their silence. But this silence is an aid to thought as well as\n",
      "observation, and gives importance to every sound, as the white snow\n",
      "gives prominence to visual objects. When the winter sun is bright and\n",
      "the chilly atmosphere is calm, we may listen to the distant village hum\n",
      "with a sensation of melody; and we catch the gurgling sounds of streams\n",
      "under the glistening ice, and the voices of jubilant echoes, that send\n",
      "back in the general stillness every sound that penetrates their secret\n",
      "shell. The crumpling of the hardened snow under our feet produces a tone\n",
      "that silence alone could turn to music; and the rustling of every zephyr\n",
      "seems like a living note in this solitude. The occasional voices of\n",
      "winter birds have a charm hardly less delightful than the melodies of\n",
      "June, when every note is but the part of a general chorus. In winter we\n",
      "listen to sounds because they are few. Even the lowing of herds is\n",
      "musical, reminding us that our present solitude is encompassed by life\n",
      "and civilization.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wood is no longer a green recess, a temple of leafy beauty, a\n",
      "sanctuary of shade, an orchestra of melodious voices. There is perhaps\n",
      "less solemnity within it than when it is darkened by overarching\n",
      "foliage. The sun shines into it and renders some little nooks more\n",
      "cheerful than at any other season. I have often lingered in one of these\n",
      "sunny retreats to watch the chickadees and woodpeckers, that never fail\n",
      "to appear in sight, diligently exploring every branch of the neighboring\n",
      "trees. It is pleasant to woo this solitude when thus enlivened by the\n",
      "sun, to saunter along the turfy wood-paths, still green with clumps of\n",
      "moss and lycopodium, to look up into the lofty trees which have parted\n",
      "with their shade, observing the sculptured elegance of their limbs and\n",
      "the intricate beauty of their spray; pondering on the rare carvings of\n",
      "their bark, broken into many geometrical forms, and the curious devices\n",
      "of nature displayed in the incrustations upon their surface.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Larch, though one of the coniferous trees, is not an evergreen. It\n",
      "is generally known in this country as the Hacmatack, a name given it by\n",
      "the Indians. In favorable situations it attains a great height, though\n",
      "we are familiar with it as a tree of but ordinary size and stature. Its\n",
      "branches are very numerous, and irregularly disposed at right angles\n",
      "with the main stem, and not in very apparent whorls. The terminal\n",
      "branches are small and numerous, making considerable spray, but without\n",
      "much character. The American and the European Larch do not differ in\n",
      "their manner of putting forth their larger branches, nor in their\n",
      "botanical characters. They are distinguished, however, by an important\n",
      "difference in the style of their secondary branches. The European tree\n",
      "has a graceful hanging spray, drooping perpendicularly from its\n",
      "horizontal boughs, and swinging in the wind like that of the Norway\n",
      "spruce. The American tree has a shorter spray, not in the least pendent,\n",
      "with an appearance of more sturdiness, and less formality of outline. It\n",
      "displays, therefore, less of that beauty which is caused by flowing\n",
      "lines; on the other hand, it exhibits more firmness in its general\n",
      "aspect, and is a more stately tree. I prefer the American Larch because\n",
      "it departs further from that primness which distinguishes the coniferous\n",
      "trees. As it increases in height, it loses its tapering summit, and\n",
      "forms a head of flattened and irregular shape.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Larch bears no part in romantic history. Neither the ancient poets\n",
      "nor historians say much about it. Hence it is probable that it was not\n",
      "abundant in the forests of the southern part of Europe in the days of\n",
      "Homer and Virgil. Even its importance in furnishing the most durable\n",
      "wood for naval purposes is a discovery of modern times, and not until a\n",
      "very late period was it employed as an ornamental tree. The Larch is\n",
      "reputed in Europe to surpass all other trees as a fertilizer of the soil\n",
      "by the decomposition of its foliage. Another of its advantages, when\n",
      "used for plantations, is its thrifty habit on lofty sites, having a more\n",
      "elevated range than any other tree of equal importance. Gilpin remarks\n",
      "of the European tree: â€œIt claims the Alps and the Apennines for its\n",
      "native country, where it thrives in higher regions of the air than any\n",
      "other tree of its consequence is known to do, hanging over rocks and\n",
      "precipices which have never been visited by human feet. Often it is\n",
      "felled by some Alpine peasant and thrown athwart some yawning chasm,\n",
      "where it affords a tremendous passage from cliff to cliff, while the\n",
      "cataract, roaring many fathoms below, is seen only in surges of rising\n",
      "vapor.â€\n",
      "\n",
      "The American Larch tends to uniformity of shape when young and to\n",
      "variety when old. Yet the fine pyramidal forms of the young trees, and\n",
      "the fantastic and irregular shapes of those of older growth, are equally\n",
      "characteristic. The foliage is of a light green with a bluish tinge,\n",
      "turning to a deep orange in November, just before it falls. The bright\n",
      "crimson cones of the Larch, that appear in June, may be reckoned among\n",
      "its minor beauties. This tree is more abundant in Maine and New\n",
      "Hampshire than in any other part of the United States, though even there\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hemlock is confessedly one of the most beautiful of the coniferous\n",
      "evergreens, though rather narrow in its dimensions. The principal\n",
      "branches are small and short with very slender terminations, in which it\n",
      "differs from all the other spruces. The multitude of these slender\n",
      "sprays, and their rows of soft delicate leaves, cause those beautiful\n",
      "undulations that characterize the foliage of this tree when moved by the\n",
      "wind. The leaves, of a light green on their upper surface and of a\n",
      "silvery whiteness beneath, are arranged in a row on each side of the\n",
      "branchlets. But while those of the other spruces are sessile, those of\n",
      "the Hemlock have slender footstalks, yielding them a slight mobility.\n",
      "The spangled glitter of the foliage is caused by a slightly tremulous\n",
      "motion of the terminal sprays.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a deep wood the Hemlock shows some very important defects. There it\n",
      "forms a shaft from fifty to eighty feet in height without any diminution\n",
      "of its size, until near the summit, where it tapers suddenly, forming a\n",
      "head of foliage that projects considerably above the general level of\n",
      "the forest. The trunk is covered with dead branches projecting from it\n",
      "on all sides, causing it to wear a very unsightly appearance; and when\n",
      "the tree is sawed into boards, they are found to extend directly through\n",
      "the sapwood of the tree, making a hole in it as round as if it were\n",
      "bored with an auger. This is caused by the continued growth of the trunk\n",
      "of the tree after the decay of its branches, every year forming a new\n",
      "circle round the branch, but not inosculating with it, as in other\n",
      "trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "The full beauty of the Hemlock is displayed on the edge of a wood, or on\n",
      "a plain where it has grown without impediment, feathering down to the\n",
      "ground. Here we observe how much less formal it is in shape than other\n",
      "conifers. When there are no gaps in its ramification, the numerous\n",
      "branches are mostly in close contact at their extremities, so that, when\n",
      "viewed from the outside of the wood, it seems nearly one uninterrupted\n",
      "mass of foliage, hiding the interior of the tree almost entirely from\n",
      "sight. In its perfection, when it has enjoyed an isolated growth,\n",
      "without any mechanical accident to mar its symmetry, it presents a fine\n",
      "tapering form without stiffness, and a mass of glittering foliage with\n",
      "which that of but few other trees is comparable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The branches of the Hemlock are very numerous, perfectly horizontal, and\n",
      "remarkable for the absence of those regular whorls that distinguish\n",
      "other trees of this genus. They are put forth irregularly from all parts\n",
      "of the trunk, turning from their horizontal position gracefully upward,\n",
      "drooping a little at their termination, and endowed with great\n",
      "flexibility. The branches are minutely subdivided, forming with their\n",
      "leaves a flat surface, somewhat like the compound pinnate leaves of the\n",
      "cicuta, or poison hemlock. From this resemblance it undoubtedly obtained\n",
      "its name. These branches lie one above another, each bending over at its\n",
      "extremities upon the surface of those below, like the feathers upon the\n",
      "wings of a bird.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bark of the Hemlock is of a reddish brown, divided by furrows that\n",
      "separate it into scales. The young trees have a smooth bark, like that\n",
      "of the balsam fir. The cones are very small, numerous, and pendent, of a\n",
      "fine crimson color when they first appear, attached to the ends of the\n",
      "branches, and arriving at maturity in the autumn. The Hemlock occupies\n",
      "all kinds of soil, though trees of a large size are found only where it\n",
      "is deep and fertile. It is fond of moisture, often extending its\n",
      "graceful boughs from the summits of granitic rocks and declivities wet\n",
      "with perpetual springs. â€œThe Hemlock is natural to the coldest regions\n",
      "of America, and begins to appear about Hudsonâ€™s Bay, near Lake St. John;\n",
      "in the neighborhood of Quebec it fills the forests, and in Nova Scotia,\n",
      "New Brunswick, the States of Maine and Vermont, and a considerable part\n",
      "of New Hampshire, it constitutes three fourths of the evergreen woods.\n",

      "heightens by contrast the verdure of other trees. This effect is the\n",

      "The pines in general have not the formality that distinguishes the fir\n",

      "observe in a symmetrical fir. Their leaves are longer, and their\n",
      "branches not so regularly given out in whorls. They are also more\n",
      "generally round-headed when old; their leaves are in small fascicles,\n",
      "containing from two to five, while those of the fir are arranged singly\n",
      "along the branch or round it. The pine contains a greater quantity of\n",
      "turpentine than any other family of resinous trees, and many of the\n",
      "species are of the highest value in the mechanic arts. In the New\n",
      "England States three species only are known, and of these two only are\n",
      "common.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most remarkable of this family of trees, and the one that comes\n",
      "nearest the fir in symmetry and formality, is the White Pine. But though\n",
      "like the fir in symmetry, it resembles it the least in all other\n",
      "qualities, having the most flexibility of foliage of all the pines, and\n",
      "bearing its leaves in fives. The White Pine, according to Michaux, â€œis\n",
      "the loftiest and most valuable of the productions of the North American\n",
      "forest. Its summit is seen at an immense distance, aspiring to heaven,\n",
      "far above the heads of the surrounding trees.â€\n",
      "\n",
      "At first sight of a full-grown and well-proportioned White Pine we are\n",
      "struck with its evident adaptedness to all purposes of shade and\n",
      "shelter, in its wide-spread, horizontal branches, and in its silken\n",
      "tufted foliage. It is not impenetrable to sunshine, but admits it in\n",
      "constant flickering beams of light; and we perceive immediately that\n",
      "there is no other tree in whose shade it would be more agreeable to\n",
      "recline on a hot summerâ€™s day, or under whose protection we might obtain\n",
      "a greater amount of comfort in winter. The uniform arrangement of its\n",
      "branches in whorls, forming a series of stages one above another, its\n",
      "tasselled foliage in long, silky tufts at the ends of the branches, and\n",
      "its symmetrical outline, constitute in the most obvious sense a\n",
      "beautiful tree. These tufts, though not pendulous, have none of the\n",
      "stiff bristling appearance of the other pines; and their verdure is of a\n",
      "sober, not a sombre tint, though rather dull in lustre.\n",

      "It is combined both with majesty and grace, and increases the grandeur\n",
      "of its appearance, like the architectural proportions of a temple in\n",
      "which grandeur could not be produced without symmetry. This tree has\n",
      "much of the amplitude so remarkable in the cedar of Lebanon. Hence the\n",
      "look of primness, which the firs always retain, is counteracted by its\n",
      "nobleness and altitude. It is combined also with a certain negligent\n",
      "habit of its leafy robes, that softens its dignity into grace, and\n",

      "cedar of Lebanon. It has no poetic history and no reputation save what\n",
      "it may have derived from the easy motion of its foliage, the gentle\n",

      "romantic shade. It has no factitious charms, but depends on its own\n",
      "intrinsic merits for the pleasure it affords either the sight or the\n",

      "We see it in our journeys projecting over eminences that are encircled\n",
      "by old roads, shading the traveller from the sun and protecting him from\n",
      "the wind. We have sat under its fragrant shade, in our pedestrian tours,\n",
      "when weary with heat and exercise we sought its coolness, and blessed it\n",
      "as one of the guardian deities of the wood. We are familiar with it in\n",
      "all pleasant, solitary places; and in our evening rambles we have\n",
      "listened underneath its boughs to the notes of the green warbler, who\n",

      "cultivated, level or abrupt. On the side of a hill it adds grandeur to\n",
      "the declivity, and yields a sweeter look of tranquillity to the green\n",
      "pastoral meadow. It gives a darker frown to the projecting cliff, and a\n",
      "more awful uncertainty to the mountain pass or the craggy ravine. Over\n",
      "desolate scenery it spreads a cheerfulness that detracts nothing from\n",
      "its power over the imagination, while it relieves it of its terrors, by\n",

      "symbol of benevolence. Under its outspread roof, numerous small animals,\n",

      "and repose. The squirrel feeds upon the kernels obtained from its cones;\n",
      "the hare browses upon the trefoil and the spicy foliage of the\n",
      "hypericum, which are protected in its shade, and the fawn reposes on its\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Pitch Pine differs very widely in its style of growth from the white\n",
      "pine, and displays fewer of those points that excite our admiration. Its\n",
      "leaves form larger and more diffusive tufts, and are more bristling and\n",
      "erect from their superior rigidity. It is remarkable for its rough and\n",
      "shaggy appearance; hence its Latin name, _rigida_. Indeed there is not a\n",
      "tree in our forest that equals it in the roughness that is manifest in\n",
      "every part of it and in every stage of its growth. This is one of the\n",
      "most common trees in the Southern â€œpine barrensâ€; and some of the\n",
      "ancient pine woods in New England were made up principally of this\n",
      "species. Such was that extensive wood near Concord, N. H., known by the\n",
      "poetic appellation of â€œDark Plains,â€ and in the early part of the\n",
      "century occupying a wide flat region in the valley of the Merrimack\n",
      "River.\n",
      "\n",
      "This species does not give out its branches horizontally, nor in regular\n",
      "whorls. They run up at rather a wide angle with the stem, forming a head\n",
      "that approaches more nearly to a globular shape than that of any other\n",
      "of the American conifers. The branches have frequently a tortuous shape;\n",
      "for when crowded in a dense wood they do not so easily perish as those\n",
      "of the white pine, but turn in various directions to find light and\n",
      "space. They are likewise often bent downwards at their terminations,\n",
      "with a very apparent curvature. There is no conifer that displays so few\n",
      "straight lines in its composition; and, having no exact symmetry in its\n",
      "proportions, it may be mutilated to a considerable extent without losing\n",
      "its normal characters of beauty.\n",
      "\n",
      "In young trees of this species the whorls of branches may be plainly\n",
      "distinguished; but as the tree increases in size, so many members of the\n",
      "whorl become abortive that all regularity of staging in their\n",
      "arrangement is destroyed. As these branches are numerous, with but\n",
      "little space between the original whorls, they seem to project from\n",
      "every part of the trunk. This tree displays very little primness in its\n",
      "shape, or of a spiry form, save when it is a very young tree. A peculiar\n",
      "habit of the Pitch Pine is that of producing little branchlets full of\n",
      "leaves along the stem from the root upwards, completely enveloping some\n",
      "of the principal boughs. These are rarely anything more than tufts of\n",
      "leaves standing out as if they had been grafted into the bark of the\n",
      "tree. It seems to be stimulated to produce this anomalous growth by the\n",
      "loss of its small branches. It then soon covers itself with this\n",
      "embroidery, and thus garlanded presents a picturesque appearance more\n",
      "interesting than that of the perfect trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have seen very beautiful Pitch Pine trees of an abnormal shape, caused\n",
      "by the loss, when young, of the leading shoot. The lateral branches next\n",
      "below this terminal bud, being thus converted into leaders, produce two\n",
      "and sometimes three leading branches, giving the tree some of the\n",
      "characters of the deciduous species. The white pine is not improved by a\n",
      "similar accident, as it loses thereby the expression of grandeur that\n",
      "comes from the length and size of its lateral branches, which are always\n",
      "diminished by coming from two or more leading shafts. Michaux remarks\n",
      "that when Pitch-Pines â€œgrow in masses, the cones are dispersed singly\n",
      "over the branches, and they shed their seeds the first autumn after they\n",
      "mature. But on solitary trees the cones are collected in groups of four\n",
      "or five, or even a larger number, and will remain on the trees, closed,\n",
      "for several years.â€\n",
      "\n",
      "The Pitch Pine abounds all along the coast from Massachusetts to the\n",
      "Carolinas; but it is rare in the northern parts of Maine and New\n",
      "Hampshire and north of these States. It is said to have been very\n",
      "abundant in the southern part of New England before the eighteenth\n",
      "century, but large forests of it were consumed in making tar for\n",
      "exportation to Great Britain. The Pitch Pine woods of the present day\n",
      "consist of small stunted trees, showing by their inferior thrift that\n",
      "they stand upon an exhausted soil.\n",
      "\n",
      "The trees of this species, for the most part too homely and rough to\n",
      "please the sight, are not generally admired as objects in the landscape;\n",
      "but there is a variety in their shapes that makes amends for their want\n",
      "of comeliness and gives them a marked importance in scenery. We do not\n",
      "in general sufficiently estimate the value of homely objects among the\n",
      "scenes of nature, though they are indeed the groundwork of all charming\n",
      "scenery, and set off to advantage the beauty of more comely objects.\n",
      "They give rest and relief to the eye, after it has felt the stimulus of\n",
      "beautiful forms and colors, that would soon pall upon the sense; and\n",
      "they leave imagination free to dress the scene according to our own\n",
      "fancy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence I am led to prize many a homely tree as possessing a high value,\n",
      "by exalting our susceptibility to beauty, and by relieving nature of\n",
      "that monotony which is so apparent when all the objects in a scene are\n",
      "beautiful. We see this monotony in all dressed grounds of considerable\n",
      "extent. We soon become weary of their ever-flowing lines of grace and\n",
      "elegance, and the harmonious blending of forms and colors introduced by\n",
      "art. This principle explains the difficulty of reading a whole volume\n",
      "written in verse. We soon weary of luxuries; and after strolling in\n",
      "grounds laid out in gaudy flower-beds and smooth shaven lawn, the tired\n",
      "eye rests with tranquil delight upon rude pastures bounded by loose\n",
      "stone-walls, and hills embroidered with ferns and covered with boulders.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pines are not classed with deciduous trees, yet they shed their\n",
      "leaves in autumn with constant regularity. Late in October you may see\n",
      "the yellow or brown foliage, then ready to fall, surrounding the\n",
      "branches of the previous yearâ€™s growth, forming a whorl of brown fringe,\n",
      "surmounted by a tuft of green leaves of the present yearâ€™s growth. Their\n",
      "leaves always turn yellow before they fall. In the arbor-vitÃ¦ there is a\n",
      "curious intermixture of brown leaves with the green growth of the past\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When the Pilgrim first landed on the coast of America, the most\n",
      "remarkable feature of its scenery that drew his attention, next to the\n",
      "absence of towns and villages, was an almost universal forest. A few\n",
      "openings were to be seen near the rivers,â€”immense peat-meadows covered\n",
      "with wild bushes and gramineous plants, interspersed with little wooded\n",
      "islets, and bordered on all sides by a rugged, silent, and dreary desert\n",
      "of woods. Partial clearings had likewise been made by the Indians for\n",
      "their rude hamlets, and some spaces had been opened by fire. But the\n",
      "greater part of the country was darkened by an umbrageous mass of trees\n",
      "and shrubbery, in whose gloomy shades were ever present dangers and\n",
      "bewilderment for the traveller. In these solitudes the axe of the\n",
      "woodman had never been heard, and the forest for thousands of years had\n",
      "been subject only to the spontaneous action of natural causes. To men\n",
      "who had been accustomed to the open and cultivated plains of Europe,\n",
      "this waste of woods, those hills without prospect, that pathless\n",
      "wilderness, and its inhabitants as savage as the aspect of the country,\n",
      "must have seemed equally sublime and terrible.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when the colonists had cut roads through this desert, planted\n",
      "landmarks over the country, built houses upon its clearings, opened the\n",
      "hill-tops to a view of the surrounding prospect, and cheered the\n",
      "solitude by some gleams of civilization, then came the naturalist and\n",
      "the man of science to survey the aspect and productions of this new\n",
      "world. And when they made their first excursions over its rugged hills\n",
      "and through its wooded vales, we can easily imagine their transports at\n",
      "the sight of its peculiar scenery. How must the early botanist have\n",
      "exulted over this grand assemblage of plants, that bore resemblance to\n",
      "those of Europe only as the wild Indian resembles the fair-haired Saxon!\n",
      "Everywhere some rare herb put forth flowers at his feet, and trees of\n",
      "magnificent height and slender proportions intercepted his progress by\n",
      "their crowded numbers. The wood was so generally uninterrupted, that it\n",
      "was difficult to find a summit from which he could obtain a lookout of\n",
      "any considerable extent; but occasional natural openings exposed floral\n",
      "scenes that must have seemed like the work of enchantment. In the wet\n",
      "meadows were deep beds of moss of the finest verdure, which had seldom\n",
      "been disturbed by man or brute. On the uplands were vast fields of the\n",
      "checkerberry plant, social, like the European heath, and loaded half the\n",
      "year with its spicy scarlet fruit. Every valley presented some unknown\n",
      "vegetation to his sight, and every tangled path led him into a new scene\n",
      "of beauties and wonders. It must have seemed to him, when traversing\n",
      "this strange wilderness, that he had entered upon a new earth, in which\n",
      "nature had imitated, without repeating, the productions of his native\n",
      "East.\n",
      "\n",
      "Along the level parts of New England and the adjacent country, wherever\n",
      "the rivers were languid in their course, and partially inundated their\n",
      "banks in the spring, were frequent natural meadows, not covered by\n",
      "trees,â€”the homes of the robin and the bobolink before the white man had\n",
      "opened to them new fields for their subsistence. In the borders of these\n",
      "openings, the woods in early summer were filled with a sweet and novel\n",
      "minstrelsy, contrasting delightfully with the silence of the deeper\n",
      "forest. The notes of the birds were wild variations of those which were\n",
      "familiar to the Pilgrim in his native land, and inspired him with\n",
      "delight amidst the all-prevailing sadness of woods that presented on the\n",
      "one hand scenes both grand and beautiful, and teemed on the other with\n",
      "horrors which only the pioneer of the desert could describe.\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole continent, at the time of its discovery, from the coast to the\n",
      "Great American Desert, was one vast hunting-ground, where the nomadic\n",
      "inhabitants obtained their subsistence from the chase of countless herds\n",
      "of deer and buffalo. At this period the climate had not been modified by\n",
      "the operations of man upon the forest. It was less variable than now,\n",
      "and the temperature corresponded more definitely with the degrees of\n",
      "latitude. The winter was a season of more invariable cold, less\n",
      "interrupted by thaws. In New England and the other Northern States, snow\n",
      "fell in the early part of December, and lay on the ground until April,\n",
      "when the spring opened suddenly, and was not followed by those\n",
      "vicissitudes that mark the season at the present era. Such was the true\n",
      "forest climate. May-day came garlanded with flowers, lighted with\n",
      "sunshine, and breathing the odors of a true spring. It was then easy to\n",
      "foretell what the next season would be from its character the preceding\n",
      "years. Autumn was not then, as we have often seen it, extended into\n",
      "winter. The limits of each season were more precisely defined. The\n",
      "continent was annually visited by the Indian summer, that came, without\n",
      "fail, immediately after the fall of the leaf and the first hard frosts\n",
      "of November. This short season of mild and serene weather, the halcyon\n",
      "period of autumn, has disappeared with the primitive forest.\n",
      "\n",
      "The original circumstances of the country have been entirely\n",
      "revolutionized. The American climate is now in that transition state\n",
      "which has been caused by opening the space to the winds from all\n",
      "quarters by operations which have not yet been carried to their extreme\n",
      "limit. These changes of the surface have probably increased the mean\n",
      "annual temperature of the whole country by permitting the direct rays of\n",
      "the sun to act upon a wider area, while they have multiplied those\n",
      "eccentricities of climate that balk our weather calculations at all\n",
      "seasons. There are still in many parts of the country large tracts of\n",
      "wood which have not been greatly disturbed. From the observation of\n",
      "these, and from descriptions by different writers of the last century,\n",
      "we may form a pretty fair estimate of the character and aspect of the\n",
      "forest before it was invaded by civilized man.\n",
      "\n",
      "During this primitive condition of the country, the forest, having been\n",
      "left for centuries entirely to nature, would have formed a very\n",
      "intelligible geological chart. If we could have taken an extensive view\n",
      "of the New England forest, before any considerable inroads had been made\n",
      "by the early settlers, from an elevated stand on the coast, we should\n",
      "have beheld a dense and almost universal covering of trees. From this\n",
      "stand we might also trace the geological character of the soil, and its\n",
      "different degrees of fertility, dryness, and moisture, by the\n",
      "predominance of certain species and the absence of others. The\n",
      "undulations upon this vast ocean of foliage would come from the\n",
      "elevations and depressions of the ground; for the varying heights of the\n",
      "different assemblages of species upon the same level could hardly be\n",
      "perceived by a distant view. The lowest parts of this wooded region were\n",
      "at that period covered very generally with a crowded growth of the\n",
      "northern cypress, or white cedar. These evergreen swamps would\n",
      "constitute the darkest ground of the picture. The deep alluvial tracts\n",
      "would be known by the deciduous character of their woods and their\n",
      "lighter and brighter verdure, and the dry, sandy and diluvial plains and\n",
      "the gravelly hills and eminences by their white birches and tremulous\n",
      "poplars, their stunted pitch-pines and dwarfish junipers. For a century\n",
      "past the woods have been cleared mostly from the alluvial tracts; and\n",
      "the oaks, the hickories, the chestnuts, and other hard-wood trees, the\n",
      "primitive occupants of the rich and deep soils, have been succeeded in\n",
      "great measure by trees of softer wood, that originally grew on inferior\n",
      "land. The wooded aspect of the country cannot any longer be considered,\n",
      "as formerly, a good geological chart, except in some parts of Maine and\n",
      "the adjoining British Provinces.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the conditions most remarkable in a primitive forest is the\n",
      "universal dampness of the ground. The second growth of timber,\n",
      "especially if the surface were entirely cleared, stands upon a drier\n",
      "foundation. This greater dryness is caused by the absence of those vast\n",
      "accumulations of vegetable _dÃ©bris_ that rested on the ground before it\n",
      "was disturbed. A greater evaporation also takes place under the second\n",
      "growth, because the trees are of inferior size and stand more widely\n",
      "apart. Another character of a primitive forest is the crowded assemblage\n",
      "of trees and their undergrowth, causing great difficulty in traversing\n",
      "it. Innumerable straggling vines, many of them covered with thorns, like\n",
      "the green-brier, intercept our way. Immense trunks of trees, prostrated\n",
      "by hurricanes, lie in our path, and beds of moss of extreme thickness\n",
      "cover a great part of the surface, saturated with moisture. The trees\n",
      "are also covered with mosses, generated by the shade and dampness; and\n",
      "woody vines, like the climbing fern, the poison ivy, and the ampelopsis,\n",
      "fastened upon their trunks and trailing from their branches, make the\n",
      "wood in many places like the interior of a grotto. Above all, the\n",
      "traveller would notice the absence of those pleasant wood-paths that\n",
      "intersect all our familiar woods, and would find his way only by\n",
      "observing those natural appearances that serve as a compass to the\n",
      "Indian and the forester.\n",
      "\n",
      "In primitive woods there is but a small proportion of perfectly formed\n",
      "trees; and these occur only in such places as permit some individuals to\n",
      "stand in an isolated position, and spread out their arms to their full\n",
      "capacity. When rambling in a wood we take note of several conditions\n",
      "which are favorable to this full expansion of their forms. On the\n",
      "borders of a lake, a prairie, or an open moor, or of an extensive quarry\n",
      "that projects above the soil, the trees will extend their branches into\n",
      "the opening; but as they are crowded on their inner side, they are only\n",
      "half developed. This expansion, however, is on the side that is exposed\n",
      "to view; hence the incomparable beauty of a wood on the borders of a\n",
      "lake or pond, on the banks of a river as viewed from the water, and on\n",
      "the circumference of a densely wooded islet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fissures and cavities are frequent in large rocks not covered with soil,\n",
      "allowing solitary trees which have taken root in them to acquire their\n",
      "full proportions. In such places, and on eminences that rise suddenly\n",
      "above the forest level, with precipitous sides, overtopping the\n",
      "surrounding woods, we find individual trees possessing the character of\n",
      "standards, like those we see by roadsides and in open fields. But\n",
      "perfectly formed trees can only be produced in openings and on isolated\n",
      "elevations such as I have described; and it is evident that these\n",
      "favorable circumstances must be rare. The trees in a forest are like\n",
      "those human beings who from their infancy have been confined in the\n",
      "workshops of a crowded manufacturing town, and who become closely\n",
      "assimilated and lose those marks of individual character by which they\n",
      "would be distinguished if they had been reared in a state of freedom and\n",
      "in the open country.\n",
      "\n",
      "The primitive forest, in spite of its dampness, has always been subject\n",
      "to fires in dry seasons, which have sometimes extended over immense\n",
      "tracts of country. These fires were the dread of the early settlers, and\n",
      "countless lives have been destroyed by their flames often overwhelming\n",
      "entire villages. At the present time the causes of fire in the woods are\n",
      "very numerous; but before they were exposed to artificial sources of\n",
      "ignition it may have arisen from spontaneous combustion, caused by large\n",
      "accumulations of fermenting substances, or from lightning, or from the\n",
      "accidental friction of the trunks of half-prostrated trees crossing each\n",
      "other, and moved by a high wind. The forests in every part of the world\n",
      "have been subject to conflagrations; and there seems to be no other\n",
      "means that could be used by nature for removing old and worn-out\n",
      "forests, which contain more combustible materials than any young woods.\n",
      "The burned tracts in America are called barrens by the inhabitants; and\n",
      "as the vegetation on the surface is often entirely destroyed, the\n",
      "spontaneous renewal of it would display the gradual method of nature in\n",
      "restoring the forest. The successions of plants, from the beautiful\n",
      "crimson fireweed, through all the gradations of tender herbs, prickly\n",
      "bushes, and brambles, to shrubs and trees of inferior stature, until\n",
      "all, if the soil be deep and fertile, are supplanted by oaks, chestnuts,\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It is interesting to note the changes that take place from one season to\n",
      "another in the comparative beauty of certain trees. The Ash, for\n",
      "example, during the early part of October, is one of the most beautiful\n",
      "trees of the forest, exceeded only by the maple in variety of tinting.\n",
      "In summer, too, but few trees surpass it in quality of foliage, disposed\n",
      "in flowing irregular masses, light and airy, but not thin, though\n",
      "allowing the branches to be traced through it, even to their\n",
      "extremities. It has a well-rounded head, neither so regular as to be\n",
      "formal, nor so broken as to detract from its peculiar grace. When\n",
      "standing with other trees in midsummer, in the border of a wood, or\n",
      "mingled with the standards by the roadside, the Ash would be sure to\n",
      "attract admiration. But no sooner have the leaves fallen from its\n",
      "branches than it takes rank below almost all other trees, presenting a\n",
      "stiff, blunt, and awkward spray, and an entire want of that elegance it\n",
      "affects at other seasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ash is a favorite in Europe, though deficient there in autumnal\n",
      "tints. It is a tree of the first magnitude, and has been styled in\n",
      "classical poetry the Venus of the forest, from the general beauty of its\n",
      "proportions and flowing robes. The English, however, complain of the\n",
      "Ash, on account of its tardy leafing in the spring and its premature\n",
      "denudation in the autumn. â€œIts leaf,â€ says Gilpin, â€œis much tenderer\n",
      "than that of the oak, and sooner receives impression from the winds and\n",
      "frost. Instead of contributing its tint, therefore, in the wane of the\n",
      "year, among the many colored offspring of the woods, it shrinks from the\n",
      "blast, drops its leaf, and in each scene where it predominates leaves\n",
      "wide blanks of desolate boughs amid foliage yet fresh and verdant.\n",
      "Before its decay we sometimes see its leaf tinged with a fine yellow,\n",
      "well contrasted with the neighboring greens. But this is one of natureâ€™s\n",
      "casual beauties. Much oftener its leaf decays in a dark, muddy,\n",
      "unpleasing tint.â€\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ash is remarkable for a certain trimness and regularity of\n",
      "proportion, and it seldom displays any of those breaks so conspicuous in\n",
      "the outlines of the hickory, which in many points it resembles. The\n",
      "trunk rises to more than an average height before it is subdivided; but\n",
      "we do not see the central shaft above this subdivision, as in the poplar\n",
      "and the fir. Lateral branches seldom shoot from the trunk, save, as I\n",
      "have sometimes observed, a sort of bushy growth, surrounding it a little\n",
      "below the angles made by the lower branches. It is called in Europe â€œthe\n",
      "paintersâ€™ tree.â€ But George Barnard, alluding to this fact, remarks:\n",
      "â€œUnlike the oak, the Ash does not increase in picturesqueness with old\n",
      "age. The foliage becomes rare and meagre, and its branches, instead of\n",
      "hanging loosely, often start away in disagreeable forms.â€\n",
      "\n",
      "North America contains a greater number of species of the genus\n",
      "_Fraxinus_ than any other part of the globe. But three of these only are\n",
      "common in New England,â€”the white, the red, and the black Ash. The first\n",
      "is the most frequent both in the forest and by the roadsides, the most\n",
      "beautiful, and the most valuable for its timber. All the species have\n",
      "pinnate and opposite leaves, and opposite branches in all the recent\n",
      "growth; but as the tree increases in size, one of the two invariably\n",
      "becomes abortive, so that we perceive this opposite character only in\n",
      "the spray. The leaflets are mostly in sevens, not so large nor so\n",
      "unequal as in the similar foliage of the hickory.\n",
      "\n",
      "The white and the red Ash have so nearly the same external characters,\n",
      "that it requires some study to distinguish them. They do not differ in\n",
      "their ramification, nor in their autumnal hues. The black Ash may be\n",
      "readily identified by the leaves, which are sessile, and like those of\n",
      "the elder; also by the dark bluish color of the buds and newly formed\n",
      "branches, and the slenderness of its proportions. It seldom attains a\n",
      "great height or size, and is chiefly confined to swamps and muddy soils.\n",
      "The wood of this species is remarkable for strength and elasticity. The\n",
      "remarks of George Barnard respecting the localities of the Ash in Europe\n",
      "will apply to the American species: â€œThough seen everywhere, its\n",
      "favorite haunt is the mountain stream, where its branches hang\n",
      "gracefully over the water, adding much beauty to the scene. It is to be\n",
      "met with in every romantic glen and glade, now clinging with\n",
      "half-covered roots to a steep, overhanging cliff, and breaking with its\n",
      "light, elegant foliage the otherwise too abrupt line, or with its soft\n",
      "warm green relieving the monotonous coloring of the rocks or the sombre\n",
      "gray of some old ruin.â€\n",
      "\n",
      "There are some remarkable superstitions and traditionary notions\n",
      "connected with the Ash-tree. The idea that it is offensive, and even\n",
      "fatal, to serpents, is not of modern origin, though not a rustic laborer\n",
      "can be found who would not consider an Ash-tree planted before his house\n",
      "as a charm against their intrusion. According to Pliny, if a serpent be\n",
      "surrounded on one side by fire and on the other by a barricade of the\n",
      "leaves and branches of the Ash-tree, he will escape through the fire,\n",
      "rather than through its fatal boughs. It is related in the Edda that man\n",
      "was first created from the wood of this tree, and it is not improbable\n",
      "that this superstition has some connection with the fable of Adam and\n",
      "Eve, and through this with the supposed antipathy of the serpent for the\n",
      "Ash-tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a saying in Great Britain, that, if the Ash puts forth its\n",
      "leaves before the oak, the following summer will be wet; but if the\n",
      "leafing of the oak precedes that of the Ash, it will be dry. I am not\n",

      "Captain Hardy remarks that a foreigner is struck with surprise, when\n",
      "rambling through the bush, at the scarcity of birds, rabbits, and hares,\n",
      "and is astonished when in the deepest recesses of the wild country he\n",
      "sees but little increase of their numbers. When paddling his canoe\n",
      "through lake and river, he will startle but few pairs of exceedingly\n",
      "timid waterfowl where in Europe they swarm in multitudes. This scarcity\n",
      "of animals, I would remark, is not peculiar to the American wilderness.\n",
      "The same fact has been observed in extensive forests both in Europe and\n",
      "Asia; and in proportion as the traveller penetrates into their interiors\n",
      "he finds a smaller number of animals of almost every species. Birds,\n",
      "insects, and quadrupeds will multiply, like human beings, in a certain\n",

      "the trees, consisting of oak, ash, maple, and some other deciduous\n",
      "kinds, remain after the wood is felled, they will throw up suckers, and\n",

      "But if the stumps and roots of the trees should be entirely removed, it\n",
      "would be more difficult to determine what would be the character of the\n",
      "next spontaneous growth. It would probably be planted by the kinds that\n",

      "The hard-wood trees require more potash and a deeper soil than the\n",
      "coniferous and soft-wood trees. Hence they are found chiefly on alluvial\n",
      "plains and the lower slopes of mountains, where the soil is deep and\n",

      "supremacy on barren and sandy levels, and the thin soils of mountain\n",
      "declivities, too meagre to support the growth of timber of superior\n",
      "kinds. But a wood must stand a great many years, several centuries\n",
      "perhaps, after its spontaneous restoration, before this order of nature\n",
      "could be fully established. We must observe the spontaneous growth and\n",

      "timber, unless the trees were burned and their ashes restored to the\n",

      "I have already alluded to the well-known fact, that the generic\n",

      "of the soil. On sandy plains in the primitive forest, the white birch,\n",
      "the poplar, the aspen, and the pitch pine were abundant, as they are now\n",
      "on similar soils. The preference of the red maple for wet and miry soils\n",
      "is well known; while hard maple, oak, beech, and hickory do not prosper\n",
      "except in strong alluvial tracts. A heavy growth of hard timber\n",
      "indicates a superior soil; pine indicates an inferior one, if it has\n",
      "been left to the spontaneous action of nature. In the primitive forest\n",
      "we were sure of finding such relations of soil and species. They are not\n",
      "so invariable since the operations of agriculture have interrupted the\n",
      "true method of nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a wood has been burned, the process of renewal, when left to\n",
      "nature, is much more tardy than if it had been felled, since it can now\n",
      "be restored only by a regular series of vegetable species, which must\n",
      "precede it, according to certain inevitable laws. The soil, however,\n",
      "being improved and fertilized by the ashes of the burnt timber, is in a\n",
      "chemical condition to support a luxuriant forest as soon as in the\n",
      "course of nature it can be planted there. Trees will not immediately\n",
      "come up from this burnt ground as in a clearing; and if they should\n",
      "appear, they would mostly perish from the want of protection. In the\n",
      "order of nature herbaceous plants are the first to occupy the soil, and\n",
      "these are followed by a uniform succession of different species. There\n",
      "is an epilobium, or willow herb, with elegant spikes of purple flowers,\n",
      "conspicuous in our meadows in August, which is one of the earliest\n",
      "occupants of burnt ground, hence called fireweed in Maine and Nova\n",
      "Scotia. The downy appendage to its seeds causes it to be planted there\n",
      "by the winds immediately after the burning. The trillium appears also in\n",
      "great abundance upon the blackened surface of the ground in all wet\n",
      "places. Plants like the ginseng, the erythronium, and the like, whose\n",
      "bulbs or tubers lie buried deep in the mould, escape destruction, and\n",
      "come up anew. These, along with several compound plants with downy\n",

      "lands.\n",

      "But the plants mentioned above have no tendency to foster the growth of\n",

      "stripped of vegetation, as a nursery for the seedlings. All the\n",
      "phenomena of natureâ€™s rotation are but the necessary giving place of\n",
      "rapid-growing and short-lived plants to others which are perennial and\n",
      "more capable of maintaining their ground after being once planted.\n",
      "Thorns and thistles soon appear on burnt lands, and protect the young\n",
      "trees as they spring up, both from the winds and the browsing of\n",
      "animals. Thus many an oak has been nursed in a cradle of thorns and\n",
      "brambles, and many a lime-tree growing in a bower of eglantine has been\n",
      "protected by its thorns from the browsing of the goat.\n",

      "land, including many species of bramble. The fruit-bearing shrubs always\n",
      "precede the fruit-bearing trees; but the burnt land is first occupied by\n",
      "those kinds that bear a stone-fruit. Hence great numbers of cherry-trees\n",
      "and wild-plum-trees are found there, as the natural successors of the\n",
      "wild gooseberry and bramble-bushes. These are soon mixed with poplars,\n",
      "limes, and other trees with volatile seeds. But oaks, hickories, and the\n",

      "shrubbery and other vegetation. If the soil be adapted to the growth of\n",
      "heavy timber, the superior kinds, like the oak, the beech, and the hard\n",

      "has provided, in all cases, against the destruction of plants, by\n",

      "tend to perpetuate and preserve them. In this way they make amends for\n",

      "animals are an important means for promoting this end. The fruit of the\n",

      "surface of the ground, exposed to alternate dryness and moisture, and\n",
      "lose its power of germination. Only those nuts which are buried under\n",

      "consecrated to the Muse by the part which has been assigned to it in\n",
      "many a scene of romance, and by its connection with pathetic incidents\n",

      "and with the tears of the children of Israel, who sat down under the\n",
      "shade of this tree and hung their harps upon its branches. It is\n",

      "little twig becomes brightened on the surface, as if it had been glossed\n",
      "by art. The swelling of the bark occasioned by the flow of sap gives the\n",
      "whole mass a livelier hue. This appearance is very evident in the\n",
      "peach-tree, in willows and poplars, in the snowy mespilus, and in all\n",
      "trees with a long and slender spray. Hence the ashen green of the\n",
      "poplar, the golden green of the willow, and the dark crimson of the\n",
      "peach-tree, the wild rose, and the red osier, are perceptibly heightened\n",

      "different shades. On the other hand, the foliage of trees that do not\n",
      "change their color in the autumn displays only a diluted shade of green,\n",

      "locust as far off as the tree can be identified. Hence the forms of\n",
      "leaves do not produce all their effect upon a near view; but in\n",
      "ornamental designs in the fine arts the delineations of foliage alone\n",
      "are considered. In the tracery of fenestral architecture, leaves are a\n",
      "very general and favorite ornament; and in photographic pictures of\n",
      "single leaves, the beauty of their outlines becomes more evident than in\n",

      "The most remarkable quality of foliage is color; and all will admit that\n",
      "green is the only color that would not produce weariness and final\n",
      "disgust. Omitting what may be said of autumn tints, the different shades\n",
      "of green in the forest, both while the foliage is ripening and after its\n",
      "maturity, constitute a very important distinction of individuals and\n",
      "species. Pure green is rarely found in any kind, except in its early\n",
      "stage of ripeness. The foliage of trees, when fully matured, is slightly\n",
      "tinged with brown or russet, and on the under side with white or blue.\n",
      "Painters, therefore, seldom use unalloyed green in their foliage; for\n",
      "even if they would represent its appearance in early summer, when its\n",
      "verdure is nearly pure, the effects of sunshine and shade upon the green\n",
      "forest can be produced only by a liberal mixture of the warm tints of\n",
      "orange and yellow when the sunshine falls upon it, and of purple and\n",
      "violet when it is in shadow.\n",

      "If I were to select an example of what seems to me the purest green of\n",
      "vegetation, I should point to grass when smoothly shorn, as in a\n",
      "well-dressed lawn, so that the leaf only remains. By comparing the\n",
      "verdure of different trees with this example, we shall find it generally\n",
      "of a darker shade and inferior purity. The only trees of our soil that\n",
      "seem to me lighter, when in leaf, than grass, are the plane and the\n",
      "catalpa. We must observe trees on a cloudy day to distinguish the\n",
      "different shades of their foliage with precision. In such a state of the\n",
      "atmosphere they are all equally favored by the light; while, if the sun\n",
      "shines upon them, their verdure is modified according to the direction\n",
      "in which it is viewed.\n",
      "\n",
      "That kind of foliage to which the epithet â€œsilverâ€ is usually applied is\n",
      "a very general favorite; but it is admired only because it is rare. I\n",
      "cannot believe, if the two kinds were equally common, that the silver\n",
      "leaf would be preferred to the green; for this is the color that affords\n",
      "the most enduring satisfaction. The white poplar is the most remarkable\n",
      "example of silver foliage. The river maple has less of this quality,\n",
      "though it seems to be one of the points for which it is admired. Nature\n",
      "displays but very little variegated foliage among her wild productions,\n",
      "except in the spring and autumn. It is evidently an abnormal habit;\n",
      "hence we find this variegation chiefly in those plants which have been\n",
      "modified by the cultivatorâ€™s art, and it seldom constitutes a specific\n",
      "mark of distinction.\n",

      "In our studies of foliage we must not overlook the grasses, which are\n",
      "composed almost entirely of leaves. They contribute as much to the\n",
      "beauty of landscape as the verdure of trees, and collectively more than\n",
      "flowers. We need only a passing thought to convince us how tame and\n",
      "lifeless the landscape would be, though every hill were crowned with\n",
      "flowers, and every tree blossomed with gay colors, if there were no\n",
      "grasses or some kind of herbage to take their place. Hence the superior\n",

      "outspread upon their surface, to possess a moral or relative beauty\n",
      "displayed by few other natural objects. There is nothing else in\n",
      "landscape to be compared with it, and nearly all outdoor scenes would be\n",
      "cold and insipid without it. It expresses the fertility of the soil; it\n",
      "tells of gentle showers that have not been wanting; and it becomes\n",
      "thereby the symbol of providential care, the sign of pastoral abundance\n",
      "and rural prosperity. We find the grasses only where nature has made the\n",
      "greatest provision for the comfort and happiness of man and animals. All\n",
      "the beauties and bounties of springtime and harvest gather round them;\n",
      "the dews of morning glisten upon them like stars in the heavens; the\n",
      "flowers are sprinkled upon them like gems in beautiful tapestry; the\n",
      "little brooks ripple through them with sounds that are always cheerful,\n",
      "and flash in the sunlight as they leap over their bending blades. The\n",
      "merry multitudes of the insect race gain from them shelter and\n",

      "meadows of thin soil, covered with sweet-fern and whortleberry-bushes,\n",
      "stood on the brink of this pond. It was an ancient Tupelo, and attracted\n",
      "the attention of every visitor by the singular manner in which it spread\n",
      "its long branches in a crooked and horizontal direction over this\n",
      "emerald pool. It became the wonder of all that the tree should adopt\n",
      "such an eccentricity of habit, hardly showing a single branch on the\n",
      "land side, and bending over the water like an angler sitting at his\n",
      "task. It was evident that it had never been trimmed into this shape by\n",
      "artificial means. Many people, therefore, believed that its grotesque\n",
      "appearance had some connection with witchcraft, and that the witches who\n",
      "were hanged upon it had caused all the branches to wither and fall on\n",
      "the side that held the victims.\n",

      "This tree has, I believe, no representative on the old continent; and\n",
      "though there are several species in the United States, only one is found\n",
      "in New England. Here it is one of the most remarkable trees as a\n",
      "picturesque object in landscape. Indeed, there is no other tree, not\n",
      "excepting the oak, that will compare with it in certain eccentricities\n",
      "of habit. It has received a variety of names in different parts of the\n",

      "â€œUmbrella Tree,â€ from a peculiar habit of some individuals to become\n",
      "flattened and slightly convex at the top. Among our country people it is\n",
      "known as the â€œWild Pear,â€ from a fancied resemblance between its foliage\n",
      "and that of the common pear-tree. The resemblance seems to consist only\n",
      "in the size and gloss of its leaves. In the Middle and Southern States\n",
      "it is called the â€œSour Gum,â€ to distinguish it from the â€œSweet Gum,â€ or\n",

      "sometimes quite erect, extending its branches horizontally and pretty\n",
      "equally on all sides, but generally forming a more or less flattened\n",
      "top. More frequently the Tupelo displays no symmetry of any kind,\n",
      "extending its branches mostly on one side, and often putting forth two\n",
      "or three branches greatly beyond all the others. Many of these are\n",
      "considerably twisted, inclining downward from a horizontal position, not\n",
      "with a curve like those of the elm, but straight, like those of the\n",
      "spruce, though without any of its formality. The spray is very different\n",
      "from that of other trees. Every important branch is covered all round,\n",
      "at top, bottom, and sides, with short twigs, at right angles with the\n",

      "unlike. It is remarkable that an isolated situation, which is favorable\n",
      "to symmetry and good proportions in other trees, increases the specific\n",
      "peculiarities of the Tupelo. If it has stood alone and sent forth its\n",

      "branches are irregular, waving or crooked, going out at various but\n",
      "large angles, and usually from a low point on its trunk.â€ Old Gerard\n",
      "remarks concerning the English Hornbeam: â€œThe wood or timber is better\n",
      "for arrows and shafts, pulleys for mills, and such like devices, than\n",

      "I will confess that I join in the admiration so generally bestowed upon\n",
      "the American Elm. To me no other tree seems so beautiful or so majestic.\n",
      "It does not exhibit the sturdy ruggedness of the oak; it is not so\n",
      "evidently defiant of wind and tempest. It seems, indeed, to make no\n",
      "outward pretensions of strength. It bends to the breeze which the oak\n",
      "defies, and is more seldom, therefore, broken by the wind. The Elm is\n",
      "especially the wayside tree of New England, and it forms the most\n",
      "remarkable feature of our domestic landscape. If there be in any other\n",
      "section of our land as many, they are individuals mingled with the\n",
      "forest, and are not so frequent by the roadsides. In this part of the\n",
      "country the Elm has been planted and cherished from the earliest period\n",
      "of our history, and the inhabitants have always looked upon it with\n",
      "admiration, and valued it as a landscape ornament above every other\n",
      "species. It is the most drooping of the drooping trees, except the\n",
      "willow, which it surpasses in grandeur and in the variety of its forms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though the Elm has never been consecrated by the muse of classic song,\n",
      "or dignified by making a figure in the paintings of the old masters, the\n",
      "native inhabitant of New England associates the varied forms of this\n",
      "tree with all that is delightful in the scenery or memorable in the\n",
      "history of our land. All spacious avenues are bordered with elms, and\n",
      "their magnificent rows are everywhere familiar to his sight. He has seen\n",
      "them extending their broad and benevolent arms over many a hospitable\n",
      "mansion and many a humble cottage, and equally harmonizing with all.\n",
      "They meet his sight in the public grounds of the city with their ample\n",
      "shade and flowing spray; and he beholds them in the clearing, where they\n",
      "were left by the woodman to stand as solitary landmarks of the\n",
      "devastated space. Every year of his life he has seen the beautiful\n",
      "hangbird weave his pensile nest upon the long and flexible branches,\n",
      "secure from the reach of every foe. From its vast dome of branches and\n",
      "foliage he has listened to the songs of the late and early birds, and\n",
      "under its canopy he has witnessed many a scene of rustic amusement.\n",
      "\n",
      "To a native of New England, therefore, the Elm has a character more\n",
      "nearly approaching that of sacredness than any other tree. Setting aside\n",
      "the pleasure derived from it as an object of material beauty, it reminds\n",
      "him of the familiar scenes of home and the events of his early life. How\n",
      "many a happy assemblage of children and young persons has been gathered\n",
      "under its shade in the sultry noons of summer! How many a young May\n",
      "queen has been crowned under its tasselled roof, when the greensward was\n",
      "just daisied with the early flowers of spring! And how often has the\n",
      "weary traveller rested from his journey under its wide-spreading boughs,\n",
      "and from a state of weariness and vexation, when oâ€™erspent by heat and\n",
      "length of way, subsided into quiet thankfulness and content!\n",
      "\n",
      "In my own mind the Elm is intimately allied with those old\n",
      "dwelling-houses which were built in the early part of the last century,\n",
      "and form one of the principal remaining features of New England home\n",
      "architecture during that period. They are known by their broad and ample\n",
      "but low-studded rooms, their two stories in front, their numerous\n",
      "windows with small panes, their single chimney in the centre of the\n",
      "roof, that sloped down to one story in the rear, and their general\n",
      "homely appearance, reminding us of the simplicity of life that\n",
      "characterized our people before the Revolution. Their very homeliness is\n",
      "attractive, by leaving the imagination free to dwell upon their\n",
      "interesting suggestions. Not many of these venerable houses are now\n",
      "extant; but whenever we see one, it is almost invariably accompanied by\n",
      "its Elm, standing upon the green open space that slopes down from it in\n",
      "front, waving its long branches in melancholy grandeur above the old\n",
      "homestead, and drooping, as with sorrow, over the infirmities of its old\n",
      "companion of a century.\n",
      "\n",
      "Early in April the Elm puts forth its flowers, of a dark maroon color,\n",
      "in numerous clusters, fringing the long terminal spray, and filling up\n",
      "the whole space so effectually that the branches can hardly be seen;\n",
      "they appear at the same time with the crimson flowers of the red maple,\n",
      "and give the tree a very sombre appearance. The seeds ripen early, and\n",
      "being small and chaffy are wafted in all directions and carried to great\n",
      "distances by the wind. In the early part of June, soon after the leaves\n",
      "are expanded, the Elm displays the most beauty. At this time only can\n",
      "its verdure be considered brilliant: for the leaf soon fades to a dull\n",
      "green, and displays no tints, except that of a rusty yellow in the\n",
      "autumn. In perfectly healthy elms, standing on a deep soil, the\n",
      "brightness of the foliage is retained to a later period; but the trees\n",
      "near Boston have suffered so much from the ravages of the cankerworm\n",
      "that their health is injured, and their want of vitality is shown by the\n",
      "premature fading and dropping of their foliage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing can exceed the American Elm in a certain harmonious combination\n",
      "of sturdiness and grace,â€”two qualities which are seldom united. Along\n",
      "with its superior magnitude, we observe a great length and slenderness\n",
      "of its branches, without anything in the combination that indicates\n",
      "weakness. It is very agreeable to witness the union, under any\n",
      "circumstances, of two interesting or admirable traits of character which\n",
      "are supposed to be incompatible. Hence the complacency we feel when we\n",
      "meet a brave man who is amiable and polite, or a learned man who is\n",
      "neither reserved nor pedantic. A slender vine, supported by a sturdy\n",
      "tree, forms a very agreeable image; not less delightful is that\n",
      "consonance we perceive in a majestic Elm, formed by the union of\n",
      "grandeur with the gracefulness of its own flowing drapery.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Elm is generally subdivided into several equal branches, diverging\n",
      "from a common centre at a small distance above the ground. The height of\n",
      "this divergence depends on the condition of the tree when it was a\n",
      "seedling, whether it grew in a forest or in an open field; and the angle\n",
      "made by these branches is much wider when it obtained its growth in an\n",
      "isolated situation. The shape of different elms varies more than that of\n",
      "any other known species. It is indeed almost the only tree which may be\n",
      "said to exhibit more than one normal figure, setting aside those\n",
      "variations of form which are the natural effects of youth and age. The\n",
      "American Elm never displays one central shaft to which the branches are\n",
      "subordinate, like the English Elm; or rather, I should say, that when it\n",
      "has only a single shaft it is without any limbs, and is surrounded only\n",
      "with short and slender twigs. This leads me to speak of its normal\n",

      "from the time it was a seedling until it attains its full stature in an\n",
      "open space. It then shows a broad hemispherical head, formed by branches\n",
      "of nearly equal size, issuing chiefly from a common centre, diverging\n",
      "first at a small angle, and gradually spreading outward with a curve\n",
      "that may be traced throughout their length. A considerable number of our\n",

      "\n",
      "One of the most admirable of these different forms is that of the vase.\n",
      "The base is represented by the roots of the tree as they project above\n",
      "the ground, making a sort of pedestal for the trunk. The neck of the\n",
      "vase is the trunk before it is subdivided. The middle of the vase\n",
      "consists of the lower part of the branches as they swell outwards with a\n",
      "graceful curve, then gradually diverge, until they bend over at their\n",
      "extremities and form the lip of the vase by a circle of terminal spray.\n",
      "Perfect specimens of this beautiful form are rare, but in a row or a\n",

      "this type.\n",

      "variety is seen in those elms which have grown to their full height in\n",

      "the general admiration of this tree, that great numbers of them are left\n",
      "in clearings in all parts of the country. The State of Maine abounds in\n",
      "trees of this form, sending forth almost perpendicularly a number of\n",
      "branches, that spread out rather suddenly at a considerable height, in\n",
      "the shape of an umbrella. Trees of this type have much of that grandeur\n",
      "which is caused by great height and small dimensions, as observed in a\n",
      "palm-tree. A remarkable trait in the character of the Elm is, that,\n",
      "unlike other trees, it seldom loses its beauty, and is often improved in\n",
      "shape, by growing while young in a dense assemblage. It is simply\n",
      "modified into a more slender shape, usually subdivided very near the\n",
      "ground into several branches that diverge but little until they reach\n",
      "the summit of the wood. Other trees, when they have grown in a dense\n",

      "The most singular of the forms assumed by the Elm, and which cannot be\n",
      "regarded as of a normal character, is the plume, caused by some peculiar\n",
      "conditions attending its early growth. The shaft is sometimes double,\n",
      "but usually not divided at all, except into two or three small branches\n",
      "at its very summit. It is perpendicular to near three fourths of its\n",
      "height, and then bends over, like one of the outer branches of a\n",
      "normal-shaped Elm. This whole tree, whether double or single, is covered\n",
      "from the ground to its summit with a dense embroidery of vine-like twigs\n",
      "that cluster round it in all ways, often inverted, as if it were covered\n",
      "with a woody vine. The cause of this form seems to be the removal of the\n",
      "tree into an uncongenial soil, that is too scanty and innutritious to\n",
      "sustain a healthy growth. Yet I have seen some trees of this shape in\n",

      "about ten acres, surrounded by a narrow stream that was fed by a steep\n",
      "ridge forming a sort of amphitheatre round more than half its\n",
      "circumference. The ridge was a declivity of near a hundred feet in\n",
      "height, and so steep that you could climb it only by taking hold of the\n",
      "trees and bushes that covered it. The whole surface consisted of a thin\n",
      "stratum of soil deposited upon a slaty rock; but the growth of trees\n",
      "upon this slope was beautiful and immense, and the water that was\n",
      "constantly trickling from a thousand fountains kept the ground all the\n",
      "year green with mosses and ferns, and gay with many varieties of\n",
      "flowers. The soil was so rich in the meadow enclosed by this ridge, and\n",
      "annually fertilized by the _dÃ©bris_ washed from the hills, that the\n",
      "proprietor every summer filled his barns with hay, which was obtained\n",
      "from it without any cultivation.\n",
      "\n",
      "I revisited this spot a few years since, after a long period of absence.\n",
      "A new owner, â€œa man of progress and enterprise,â€ had felled the trees\n",
      "that grew so beautifully on the steep sides of this elevation, and\n",
      "valley and hill have become a dreary and unprofitable waste. The thin\n",
      "soil that sustained the forest, no longer protected by the trees and\n",
      "their undergrowth, has been washed down into the valley, leaving nothing\n",
      "but a bald, rocky surface, whose hideousness is scarcely relieved by a\n",
      "few straggling vines. The valley is also ruined; for the inundations to\n",
      "which it is subject after any copious rain destroy every crop that is\n",
      "planted upon it, and render it impracticable for tillage. It is covered\n",
      "with sand heaps; the little stream that glided round it, fringed with\n",
      "azaleas and wild roses, has disappeared, and the land is reduced to a\n",
      "barren pasture.\n",
      "\n",
      "The general practice of the pioneers of civilization on this continent\n",
      "was to cut down the wood chiefly from the uplands and the lower slopes\n",
      "of the hills and mountains. They cleared those tracts which were most\n",
      "valuable for immediate use and cultivation. Necessity led them to pursue\n",
      "the very course required by the laws of nature for improving the soil\n",
      "and climate. The first clearings were made chiefly for purposes of\n",
      "agriculture; and as every farm was surrounded by a rampart of woods, it\n",
      "was sheltered from the force of the winds and pleasantly open to the\n",
      "sun. But when men began to fell the woods to supply the demands of towns\n",
      "and cities for fuel and lumber, these clearings were gradually deprived\n",
      "of their shelter, by levelling the surrounding forest and opening the\n",
      "country to the winds from every quarter. But the clearing of the wood\n",
      "from the plains, while it has rendered the climate more unstable, has\n",
      "not been the cause of inundations or the diminution of streams. This\n",
      "evil has been produced by clearing the mountains and lesser elevations\n",
      "having steep or rocky sides; and if this destructive work is not checked\n",
      "by legislation or by the wisdom of the people, plains and valleys now\n",
      "green and fertile will become profitless for tillage or pasture, and the\n",
      "advantages we shall have sacrificed will be irretrievable in the\n",
      "lifetime of a single generation. The same indiscriminate felling of\n",
      "woods has rendered many a once fertile region in Europe barren and\n",
      "uninhabitable, equally among the cold mountains of Norway and the sunny\n",
      "plains of Brittany.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our climate suffers more than formerly from summer droughts. Many\n",
      "ancient streams have entirely disappeared, and a still greater number\n",
      "are dry in summer. Boussingault mentions a fact that clearly illustrates\n",
      "the condition to which we may be exposed in thousands of locations on\n",
      "this continent. In the island of Ascension there was a beautiful spring,\n",
      "situated at the foot of a mountain which was covered with wood. By\n",
      "degrees the spring became less copious, and at length failed. While its\n",
      "waters were annually diminishing in bulk, the mountain had been\n",
      "gradually cleared of its forest. The disappearance of the spring was\n",
      "attributed to the clearing. The mountain was again planted, and as the\n",
      "new growth of wood increased, the spring reappeared, and finally\n",
      "attained its original fulness. More to be dreaded than drought, and\n",
      "produced by the same cause,â€”the clearing of steep declivities of their\n",
      "wood,â€”are the excessive inundations to which all parts of the country\n",
      "are subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "If it were in the power of man to dispose his woods and tillage in the\n",
      "most advantageous manner, he might not only produce an important\n",
      "amelioration of the general climate, but he might diminish the frequency\n",
      "and severity both of droughts and inundations, and preserve the general\n",
      "fulness of streams. If every man were to pursue that course which would\n",
      "protect his own grounds from these evils, it would be sufficient to\n",
      "bring about this beneficent result. If each owner of land would keep all\n",
      "his hills and declivities, and all slopes that contain only a thin\n",
      "deposit of soil or a quarry, covered with forest, he would lessen his\n",
      "local inundations from vernal thaws and summer rains. Such a covering of\n",
      "wood tends to equalize the moisture that is distributed over the land,\n",
      "causing it, when showered upon the hills, to be retained by the\n",
      "mechanical action of the trees and their undergrowth of shrubs and\n",
      "herbaceous plants, and by the spongy surface of the soil underneath\n",
      "them, made porous by mosses, decayed leaves, and other _dÃ©bris_, so that\n",
      "the plains and valleys have a moderate oozing supply of moisture for a\n",
      "long time after every shower. Without this covering, the water when\n",
      "precipitated upon the slopes, would immediately rush down over an\n",
      "unprotected surface in torrents upon the space below.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every one has witnessed the effects of clearing the woods and other\n",
      "vegetation from moderate declivities in his own neighborhood. He has\n",
      "observed how rapidly a valley is inundated by heavy showers, if the\n",
      "rising grounds that form its basin are bare of trees and planted with\n",
      "the farmerâ€™s crops. Even grass alone serves to check the rapidity with\n",
      "which the water finds its way to the bottom of the slope. Let it be\n",
      "covered with bushes and vines, and the water flows with a speed still\n",
      "more diminished. Let this shrubbery grow into a forest, and the valley\n",
      "would never be inundated except by a long-continued and flooding rain.\n",
      "Woods and their undergrowth are indeed the only barriers against\n",
      "frequent and sudden inundations, and the only means in the economy of\n",
      "nature for preserving an equal fulness of streams during all seasons of\n",
      "the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first thought, it may seem strange that the clearing of forests\n",
      "should be equally the cause both of drought and inundations; but these\n",
      "apparently incompatible facts are easily explained by considering the\n",
      "different effects produced by woods standing in different situations. An\n",
      "excess of moisture in the valleys comes from the drainage of the hills,\n",
      "and the same conditions that will cause them to be dried up at certain\n",
      "times will cause them to be flooded at others. Natureâ€™s design seems to\n",
      "be to preserve a constant moderate fulness of streams and standing\n",
      "water. This purpose she accomplishes by clothing the general surface of\n",
      "the country with wood. When man disturbs this arrangement, he may\n",
      "produce evil consequences which he had never anticipated. We are not,\n",
      "however, to conclude that we may not improve the soil and climate by\n",
      "changing the original condition of this wooded surface. The clearing of\n",

      "with the dark-colored branches, and an outline regular and symmetrical\n",
      "without formality. When covered with leaves, it bears some resemblance\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "While Nature, in the forms of trees, in the color of their foliage and\n",
      "the gracefulness of their spray, has displayed a great variety of\n",
      "outline and tinting, and provided a constant entertainment for the\n",
      "sight, she has increased their attractions by endowing them with a\n",
      "different susceptibility to motion from the action of the winds. In\n",
      "their motions we perceive no less variety than in their forms. The\n",
      "different species differ like animals; some being graceful and easy,\n",
      "others stiff and awkward; some calm and intrepid, others nervous and\n",
      "easily agitated. Perhaps with stricter analogy we might compare them to\n",
      "human beings; for we find trees that represent the man of quiet and\n",
      "dignified deportment, also the man of excited manners and rapid\n",
      "gesticulations. Some trees, like the fir, having stiff branches and\n",
      "foliage, move awkwardly backward and forward in the wind, without any\n",
      "separate motions of their leaves. While we admire the symmetrical and\n",
      "stately forms of such trees, we are reminded of men who present a noble\n",
      "personal appearance, accompanied with ungainly manners.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some trees, having stiff branches with flexible leaves, do not bend to a\n",
      "moderate breeze, but their foliage readily yields to the motion of the\n",
      "wind. This habit is observed in the oak and the ash, in all trees that\n",
      "have a pendulous foliage and upright or horizontal branches. The poplars\n",
      "possess this habit in a remarkable degree, and it is proverbial in the\n",
      "aspen. It is also conspicuous in the common pear-tree and in the small\n",
      "white birch. Other trees, like the American elm, wave their branches\n",
      "gracefully, with but little apparent motion of their leaves. We observe\n",
      "the same habit in the weeping willow, and indeed in all trees with a\n",
      "long and flexible spray. The wind produces by its action on these a\n",
      "general sweeping movement without any rustle. It is easy to observe,\n",
      "when walking in a grove, that the only graceful motions come from trees\n",
      "with drooping branches, because these alone are long and slender.\n",
      "\n",
      "The very rapid motion of the leaves of the aspen has given origin to\n",
      "some remarkable superstitions. The Highlanders of Scotland believe the\n",
      "wood of this tree to be that of which the holy cross was made, and that\n",
      "its leaves are consequently never allowed to rest. Impressed with the\n",
      "awfulness of the tragedy of the crucifixion, they are constantly\n",
      "indicating to the winds the terrors that agitate them. The small white\n",
      "birch displays considerable of the same motion of the leaves; but we\n",
      "take little notice of it, because they are softer and produce less of a\n",
      "rustling sound. The flickering lights and shadows observed when walking\n",
      "under these trees, on a bright noonday, have always been admired. All\n",
      "these habits awaken our interest in trees and other plants by\n",
      "assimilating them to animated things.\n",
      "\n",
      "Much of the beauty of the silver poplar comes from its glittering\n",
      "lights, when it presents the green upper surface of its foliage,\n",
      "alternating rapidly with the white silvery surface beneath. This we may\n",
      "readily perceive even in cloudy weather, but in the bright sunshine the\n",
      "contrasts are very brilliant. In all trees, however, we observe this\n",
      "glittering beauty of motion in the sunshine. The under part of leaves\n",
      "being less glossy than the upper part, there is in the assemblage the\n",
      "same tremulous lustre that appears on the rippled surface of a lake by\n",
      "moonlight.\n",
      "\n",
      "We observe occasionally other motions which I have not described, such\n",
      "as the uniform bending of the whole tree. In a strong current of wind,\n",
      "tall and slender trees especially attract our attention by bending over\n",
      "uniformly like a plume. This habit is often seen in the white birch, a\n",
      "tree that in its usual assemblages takes a plumelike form. When a whole\n",
      "grove of white birches is seen thus bending over in one direction from\n",
      "the action of a brisk wind, they seem like a procession of living forms.\n",
      "In a storm we watch with peculiar interest the bending forms of certain\n",
      "tall elms, such as we often see in clearings, with their heads bowed\n",
      "down almost to the ground by the force of the tempest. It is only the\n",
      "waves of the ocean and the tossing of its billows that can afford us so\n",
      "vivid an impression of the sublimity of a tempest as the violent swaying\n",
      "of a forest and the roaring of the winds among the lofty tree-tops.\n",
      "\n",
      "The motions of an assemblage of trees cannot be observed except from a\n",
      "stand that permits us to look down upon the surface formed by their\n",
      "summits. We should then perceive that pines and firs, with all the\n",
      "stiffness of their branches, display a great deal of undulating motion.\n",
      "These undulations or wavy movements are particularly graceful in a grove\n",
      "of hemlocks, when they are densely assembled without being crowded. It\n",
      "is remarkable that one of the most graceful of trees belongs to a family\n",
      "which are distinguished by their stiffness and formality. The hemlock,\n",
      "unlike other firs and spruces, has a very flexible spray, with leaves\n",
      "also slightly movable, which are constantly sparkling when agitated by\n",
      "the wind. If we look down from an opposite point, considerably elevated,\n",
      "upon a grove of hemlocks when they are exposed to brisk currents of\n",
      "wind, they display a peculiar undulating movement of the branches and\n",
      "foliage, made more apparent by the glitter of their leaves.\n",
      "\n",
      "The surface of any assemblage of trees when in motion bears a close\n",
      "resemblance to the waves of the sea. But hemlocks represent its\n",
      "undulations when greatly agitated, without any broken lines upon its\n",
      "surface. Other firs display in their motions harsher angles and a\n",
      "somewhat broken surface of the waves. We see the tops of these trees and\n",
      "their extreme branches awkwardly swaying backwards and forwards, and\n",
      "forming a surface like that of the sea when it is broken by tumultuous\n",
      "waves of a moderate height. The one suggests the idea of tumult and\n",

      "My friend, when explaining his views, alluded to the well-known fact\n",
      "that plants growing in an aquarium keep the water supplied with\n",
      "atmospheric airâ€”not with simple oxygen, but with oxygen chemically\n",
      "combined with nitrogenâ€”by some vital process that takes place in the\n",
      "leaves of plants. As the lungs of animals decompose the air which they\n",
      "inspire, and breathe out carbonic-acid gas, plants in their turn\n",
      "decompose this deleterious gas, and breathe out pure atmospheric air.\n",
      "His theory is that the atmosphere is entirely the product of vegetation,\n",
      "and that nature has no other means of composing it; that it is not\n",
      "simply a chemical, but a vital product; and that its production, like\n",

      "The use of the foliage of trees in renovating the atmosphere is not, I\n",
      "believe, denied by any man of science. This theory has been proved to be\n",
      "true by experiments in vital chemistry. The same chemical appropriation\n",
      "of gases and transpiration of oxygen is performed by all classes of\n",
      "vegetables; but any work in the economy of nature assigned to vegetation\n",
      "is the most effectually accomplished by trees. The property of foliage\n",
      "that requires carbonic-acid gas for its breathing purposes, and causes\n",
      "it to give out oxygen, is of vital importance; and it is hardly to be\n",
      "doubted that a close room well lighted by the sun would sustain its\n",
      "healthful atmosphere a longer time, if it were filled with plants in\n",
      "leaf, but not in flower, and occupied by breathing animals, than if the\n",
      "animals occupied it without the plants.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there is another function performed by the foliage of trees and\n",
      "herbs in which no chemical process is involved,â€”that of exhaling\n",
      "moisture into the atmosphere after it has been absorbed by the roots.\n",
      "Hence the humidity of this element is greatly dependent on foliage. A\n",
      "few simple experiments will show how much more rapidly and abundantly\n",
      "this evaporation takes place when the soil is covered with growing\n",
      "plants than when the surface is bare. Take two teacups of equal size and\n",
      "fill them with water. Place them on a table, and insert into one of them\n",
      "cuttings of growing plants with their leaves, and let the other stand\n",
      "with water only. In a few hours the water will disappear from the cup\n",
      "containing the plants, while that in the other cup will not be sensibly\n",
      "diminished. Indeed, there is reason to believe that gallons of water\n",
      "might be evaporated into the air by keeping the cup containing the\n",
      "cuttings always full, before the single gill contained in the other cup\n",
      "would disappear. If a few cuttings will evaporate a half-pint of water\n",
      "in twelve hours, we can imagine the vast quantity constantly exhaled\n",
      "into the atmosphere by a single tree. The largest steam-boiler in use,\n",
      "kept constantly boiling, would not probably evaporate more water than\n",
      "one large elm in the same time.\n",
      "\n",
      "We may judge, from our experiment with the cuttings, that a vastly\n",
      "greater proportion of moisture would be exhaled into the atmosphere from\n",
      "any given surface of ground when covered with vegetation, than from the\n",
      "same amount of uncovered surface, or even of standing water. Plants are\n",
      "indeed the most important existing agents of nature for conveying the\n",
      "moisture of the earth into the air. The quantity of transpiring foliage\n",
      "from a dense assemblage of trees must be immense. The evaporation of\n",
      "water from the vast ocean itself is probably small compared with that\n",
      "from the land which it surrounds. And there is reason to believe that\n",
      "the water evaporated from the ocean would not produce rain enough to\n",
      "sustain vegetation, if by any accident every continent and island were\n",
      "deprived of its trees. The whole earth would soon become a desert. I\n",

      "viewed in this manner, and all the tiresome uniformity of summer verdure\n",

      "The Oak surpasses all other trees, not only in actual strength, but also\n",
      "in that outward appearance by which this quality is manifested. This\n",
      "expression is owing to the general horizontal tendency of its principal\n",
      "boughs, the great angularity of the unions of its smaller branches, the\n",
      "want of flexibility in its spray, and its great size compared with its\n",
      "height, all manifesting power to resist the wind and the storm. Hence it\n",
      "is called the monarch of trees, surpassing all in the qualities of\n",
      "nobleness and capacity. It is the embodiment of strength, dignity, and\n",
      "grandeur. The severest hurricane cannot overthrow it, and, by destroying\n",
      "some of its principal branches, leaves it only with more wonderful proof\n",
      "of its resistance. Like a rock in mid-ocean, it becomes in old age a\n",
      "just symbol of fortitude, parting with its limbs one by one, as they are\n",
      "withered by decay or broken by the gale, but still retaining its\n",
      "many-centuried existence, when, like an old patriarch, it has seen all\n",

      "branches at a wide angle from the central shaft, which rapidly\n",
      "diminishes in size, but does not entirely disappear above the lower\n",
      "junction. No other tree displays more irregularities in its\n",
      "ramification. The beauty of its spray depends on a certain crinkling of\n",
      "the small branches; yet the Oak, which, on account of these\n",
      "angularities, is especially adapted to rude situations, is equally\n",
      "attractive in an open cultivated plain. It forms a singularly noble and\n",
      "majestic standard; and though surpassed by the elm in grace, beauty, and\n",

      "purple, crimson, and lilac. The leaves, when fully expanded in all the\n",
      "typical oaks, are deeply scalloped in a way which is peculiar to this\n",
      "genus of trees; their verdure is of more than ordinary purity; they are\n",
      "of a firm texture, and glossy upon their upper surface, like evergreen\n",

      "its perpendicular growth, having an obstinate inclination to spread. It\n",
      "has also a more abundant undergrowth than many other woods, because it\n",
      "sends its roots downward into the soil, instead of monopolizing the\n",

      "natural groups of trees to please the eye with their spontaneous beauty.\n",
      "They surround the clearing with palisades of naked pillars, unrelieved\n",

      "agriculture is carried on in large plantations, we see spacious fields\n",
      "of tillage, and forest groups of corresponding size. But the small,\n",
      "independent farming of New England has produced a charming variety of\n",
      "wood, pasture, and tillage, so agreeably intermixed that we are never\n",
      "weary of looking upon it. The varied surface of the land has increased\n",

      "sounds peculiar to the woods, exalt this impression. Indeed, the\n",

      "louder sounds, which are attended with a confused reverberation. The\n",

      "developed, having room enough to expand to their normal proportions. We\n",
      "often see their shadows cast separately upon the ground, which is green\n",
      "beneath them as in an orchard. If we look upon this assemblage from an\n",

      "as a picturesque and beautiful feature of landscape. The painter finds\n",
      "in these spontaneous collections of wood an endless variety of grouping\n",
      "and outline for the exercise of his art; and the botanist discovers, in\n",
      "their glens and hollows, hundreds of species that would perish in an\n",

      "point of junction, like the elm. Others send up their trunk nearly\n",
      "straight to the very summit of the tree, giving out lateral branches\n",
      "from all points almost horizontally. There is a third form that seems to\n",
      "have no central shaft, because it is so greatly contorted that it can\n",
      "only be traced among its subordinate branches by the most careful\n",

      "lightning is very ancient. It probably originated in some religious\n",
      "ideas of their sanctity, and men in more enlightened times have\n",
      "endeavored to explain it by philosophy, instead of rejecting it as\n",
      "fable. It was affirmed by Hugh Maxwell, an American writer, that\n",
      "lightning often strikes the elm, the chestnut, the oak, the pine, and\n",
      "less frequently the ash; but it always evades the beech, the birch, and\n",
      "the maple. Captain Dibdin remarks, in a letter to Alexander Wilson, that\n",
      "in the forests of Virginia the pines, though taller than the oaks, were\n",
      "less frequently injured by lightning, and considers them pretty secure\n",
      "when growing among oaks. These accounts by different writers are too\n",
      "various and contradictory to be of much value in aiding us to discover\n",
      "the truth. It is probable that the partial exemption of certain trees\n",
      "from the stroke of lightning, if any such accounts be true, depends on\n",
      "their size and shape. A tall tree in an assemblage would be more exposed\n",
      "than the others. It may also be supposed that if a tree has a regular\n",
      "ramification, smooth and straight branches and trunk, it is better\n",
      "formed for a conductor, and that it would be more liable to receive a\n",
      "charge of the fluid. But all these opinions are probably of the same\n",
      "character with those respecting the antipathy of serpents for certain\n",
      "trees,â€”traditionary notions which are hardly worthy of investigation.\n",
      "The opinion of the ancients concerning the immunity of the laurel was\n",
      "probably derived from their idea of its sanctity as the tree which was\n",
      "dedicated to Apollo. At the present day there exists in Italy a similar\n",
      "notion concerning the white grapevine. Some of the peasantry of that\n",
      "country are accustomed to twining its branches around the head and waist\n",
      "as a protection from a thunder-stroke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trees are generally believed to protect a house adjoining them from\n",
      "lightning; on the contrary, it is known that men and animals seeking\n",
      "refuge under a tree in an open plain are in greater danger than outside\n",
      "of it. The lightning is therefore probably conducted by the water\n",
      "passing down on the surface of the branches and trunk; for if the tree\n",
      "itself were the conductor, the lightning would pass through the trunk\n",
      "into the ground, and, like a lightning-rod, act as a protection to\n",
      "objects near, but not in contact with it. Dr. Franklin thought the\n",
      "safest place a few yards distant from a tree, and a little outside of\n",
      "its widest spread. It is unsafe to stand under the drip of a tree, which\n",
      "might convey to the person an electric charge. It was the opinion of M.\n",
      "Arago, that trees overtopping houses at small distances cannot be\n",
      "regarded as affording sure protection, like a properly adjusted\n",
      "lightning-rod; but he admitted that when a storm passes over a forest it\n",
      "is decidedly enfeebled. The forest certainly diminishes the power of a\n",

      "large assemblages. Though a house may receive but little protection from\n",

      "of its predominance in any tract that is occupied by it, and the close\n",
      "matting of leaves that covers the ground under a beechen wood prevents\n",
      "any abundance of undergrowth. The same inconvenient habit is the cause\n",
      "of its rareness in dressed grounds. George Barnard says of the English\n",
      "Beech: â€œIn no tree are the decaying hues of autumn more beautiful than\n",
      "in the Golden Beech, its foliage changing from green to the brightest\n",
      "orange, then to glowing red, and eventually to a russet brown, in which\n",
      "state the leaves remain on the tree through the winter.â€ The leaf of the\n",

      "The style and spray of the Beech, as observed in its denuded state, are\n",

      "when they start from the tree, but soon make a curvature by turning\n",
      "regularly upwards, and causing a peculiar primness in their general\n",
      "appearance. Every small twig also turns upwards, pointed with elongated\n",
      "leaf-buds, resembling so many little spears. The terminal branches,\n",
      "forming the spray, are very numerous and slender, and remarkably\n",
      "beautiful. The Beech, when in full leaf, is seen to the best advantage\n",
      "where it skirts the edge of a wood, if it has grown up there since the\n",
      "original clearing. In that situation we perceive the elegant sweep of\n",

      "pointing obliquely upwards in the direction of the spray, instead of\n",
      "hanging loosely in all ways, like the foliage of the large-leaved\n",
      "poplars. Deciduous trees have generally a drooping foliage, and the want\n",
      "of this habit in the Beech gives it a very lively appearance. The\n",
      "heaviness attributed by Gilpin to the English tree is not observed in\n",

      "distinguished from the walnut by its foliage and general habit of\n",
      "growth, by the smaller number of leaflets on the leaf-stem, and by their\n",
      "darker color and firmer texture. The aments of the Hickory are in\n",

      "The Hickory rises to a greater proportional height, with less length and\n",
      "spread of the branches, the lower ones being higher from the root of the\n",
      "tree and smaller than those of the walnut. Many of the trees are\n",
      "flattened at the top, and take a cylindrical form, when they approach to\n",

      "displaying frequent gaps, and presenting several distinct masses of\n",
      "foliage.\n",

      "The Hickory, therefore, when full-grown, has seldom much elegance, and\n",
      "little of the beauty of grace and symmetry. Its picturesque qualities\n",
      "are its sturdy habit, its great height, its dense and dark green\n",
      "foliage, its approach to a cylindrical shape, and its general\n",
      "eccentricity of growth. I have never seen a Hickory with long spreading\n",
      "branches like those of the butternut, nor with neat and prim foliage\n",

      "which is one of the most open and cultivated sections of the country, I\n",
      "entered a little valley near the sea, comprising about fifty acres of\n",
      "well-cultivated land, surrounded by a sort of amphitheatre of hills,\n",
      "which were covered with a dense forest of pines and firs. It was\n",

      "early as to astonish his neighbors in the outer world. In regard to the\n",
      "relative temperature of the woods and of the open plain in summer, he\n",
      "remarked that it varied according to the time of day or night. The woods\n",
      "were cooler than the open country, in clear, calm weather, from about\n",
      "nine oâ€™clock in the morning until near noonday; after this time the heat\n",
      "in them increased more rapidly than in the open country, and at the time\n",
      "of dew-fall it was greater in the woods, and continued so during the\n",
      "early part of the night. If the sky were cloudy, not much difference\n",
      "could be perceived at any hour in the temperature of the two situations.\n",

      "bore fruit abundantly. Palestine is now a treeless country, and the same\n",
      "fruits are incapable of enduring its climate; yet recent observations\n",
      "have demonstrated that its climate is not colder than it was in the days\n",

      "I have spoken of trees as the purifiers and renovators of the\n",
      "atmosphere, as regulators of its humidity, equalizers of the electric\n",
      "fluid, and as safeguards against both drought and inundations; but I\n",

      "the actual creators, in many places, of the soil upon which they stand.\n",
      "The trees by means of their foliage are direct fertilizers of the ground\n",
      "they cover, causing it to increase in bulk as long as they stand upon\n",
      "it. But the leaves of trees are not the only source of this increase of\n",
      "bulk and fertility. The lichens and mosses, and various incrustations\n",
      "upon their bark, and the offal of birds, insects, and quadrupeds, all\n",
      "contribute to the same end. Hence the most barren situations will\n",
      "produce good crops for several years after the removal of their wood;\n",
      "and from these facts we may learn why a forest is still vigorous, though\n",
      "it has remained for centuries upon the same ground. If it were\n",
      "fertilized only by the decayed foliage of the trees, it would gradually\n",
      "lose its fitness to promote the health and growth of the timber. But the\n",
      "foreign matters I have enumerated, the decayed cryptogamous plants, and\n",
      "the relics and deposits of animals which have lived and died there,\n",
      "supply the soil with nitrogenous ingredients in which decomposed leaves\n",
      "are wanting.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what are the sources of all the matters which are furnished by the\n",
      "trees alone? They are chiefly the atmosphere and the deeper strata of\n",
      "the soil. The roots of the trees, penetrating to a considerable depth,\n",
      "draw up from the subsoil certain nutritive salts that enter into the\n",
      "substance of all parts of the tree. This is restored to the surface by\n",
      "every tree or branch that falls and moulders upon it, and the leaves\n",
      "increase its bulk still more by their annual decay. According to\n",
      "Vaupell, â€œthe carbonic acid given out by decaying leaves, when taken up\n",
      "by water, serves to dissolve the mineral constituents of the soil, and\n",
      "it is particularly active in disintegrating feldspar and the clay\n",
      "derived from its decomposition.â€ These facts explain why the surface\n",
      "soil in a forest may constantly increase in bulk, without communication\n",

      "below. Hence, by preserving a growth of wood upon all barren slopes and\n",
      "elevations, the farmer derives benefit from it, both as a fertilizer and\n",
      "as a source of irrigation to the lower part of the slopes or the base of\n",

      "barren or steep, are unprofitable alike for tillage or pasture. They\n",
      "require more manure than other grounds, and more labor in its\n",
      "distribution. Hence, if divested of wood, as I have often repeated, they\n",
      "are almost useless; while, if densely wooded, they fertilize and\n",

      "hues, the earlier and more brilliant drop their leaves; and some are\n",
      "entirely denuded, while others are fully covered with foliage and\n",
      "verdure. Even different individuals of the same species, of maples\n",
      "especially, manifest a great difference of habit in this respect, caused\n",
      "in some cases by the peculiarities of their situation. Trees in swamps\n",
      "and low grounds lose their leaves earlier than the occupants of a deep\n",

      "are chiefly red; while the maples display as many colors as if they were\n",
      "of different species. But each individual tree shows nearly the same\n",
      "every year, as apple-trees bear fruit of the same tints from year to\n",
      "year. Two red maples growing side by side are seldom alike, and in a\n",
      "group of them you will see almost as many shades of color as trees. Some\n",
      "are entirely yellow, others scarlet, some crimson, purple, or orange,\n",
      "others variegated with several of these colors. There is more uniformity\n",
      "in the tints of the sugar maple. I have seen long rows of this species\n",
      "that were only yellow and orange, though its colors generally vary from\n",
      "orange to scarlet. Purple and crimson are confined chiefly to the red\n",
      "maple; I have seen in different individuals of this species all the hues\n",
      "that are ever displayed in the autumn woods. The red maples, more than\n",
      "all other trees combined, are the crowning glory of a New England\n",

      "colors.\n",
      "\n",
      "As early as the last week in August, we perceive the tinting of a few\n",
      "red maples, which always exhibit the earliest change. Sometimes a\n",
      "solitary branch is tinted, while the remainder of the foliage is green,\n",
      "as if something affecting its vitality had prematurely colored it.\n",
      "Frequently the coloring process begins at the top; the purple crown of\n",
      "autumn is placed upon the green brow of summer, and we behold the two\n",
      "seasons represented at once in the same tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first coloration is usually seen at the veins of the leaf, extending\n",
      "outwardly until the whole is tinted. Sometimes it appears in spots, like\n",
      "drops of blood upon the green surface; and in this case the leaf usually\n",
      "remains spotted. In the foliage of trees that assume a variety of\n",
      "colors, yellows generally predominate in the interior of the mass, red\n",
      "and purple on the outside. In the red maple, and less frequently in the\n",
      "rock maple when in a protected situation, the leaves are often formally\n",
      "variegated with figures of yellow, red, green, and purple. Those of the\n",
      "poison sumach, the cornel, and the snowy mespilus, are sometimes\n",
      "beautifully striated with yellow or orange upon a darker ground; but I\n",
      "have searched the woods in vain to find any other than a maple-leaf\n",
      "configurated like a butterflyâ€™s wing.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the foliage of the tupelo deep shades of purple first appear,\n",
      "brightening into crimson or scarlet before it falls. This tree more\n",
      "invariably shows a mass of unmixed crimson than any other species. Even\n",
      "in the maple, if the general presentation is red, you will find a\n",
      "considerable mixture of yellow. The colors of the scarlet oak are seldom\n",
      "pure or unmixed; but those of the tupelo are invariable, except as they\n",
      "pass through the gradations from purple to scarlet. If, therefore, the\n",
      "tupelo were as common in the woods as the maple, it would contribute\n",
      "more splendor to the scenery of autumn. There are many trees that never\n",
      "produce a red leaf. I have never found one in the foliage of the poplar,\n",
      "the birch, the tulip, the hickory, or the chestnut, which are all of\n",
      "some shade of yellow; but there are usually a few yellow leaves\n",
      "scattered among the ruddy foliage of any tree that assumes this color.\n",

      "When all the circumstances attending the season have been favorable to\n",
      "the tints of autumn, there is no tree of the forest that would attract\n",
      "more admiration from the beautiful sobriety of its colors than the\n",
      "American ash. But this tree is so easily affected by drought, that after\n",
      "a dry summer its leaves fall prematurely and its tints are imperfect.\n",
      "The colors of the ash are quite unique, and distinguish it from all\n",
      "other trees. Under favorable circumstances its coloring process is\n",
      "nearly uniform. It begins with a general impurpling of the whole mass of\n",
      "foliage nearly at the same time, and its gradual changes remind me of\n",
      "those observed in sea-mosses during the process of bleaching. There is\n",
      "an invariable succession in these tints, as in the brightening beams of\n",
      "morn. They are first of a dark bronze, turning from this to a chocolate,\n",
      "then to a violet brown, and finally to a salmon-color, or yellow with a\n",
      "slight shade of lilac. When the leaves are faded nearly yellow, they are\n",
      "ready to drop from the tree. It is remarkable, that, with all this\n",
      "variety of hues, neither crimson nor any shade of scarlet is ever seen\n",
      "in the ash. It ought to be remembered that the gradations of autumn\n",
      "tints in all cases are in the order of those of sunrise, from dark to\n",
      "lighter hues, and never the reverse. I make no reference to the browns\n",
      "of dead leaves, which are darker than yellow or orange, from which they\n",
      "turn. I speak only of the changes of leaves before they are seared or\n",
      "dry.\n",

      "After the middle of October, the oaks are the most conspicuous ornaments\n",
      "of the forest; but they are seldom brilliant. In their foliage there is\n",
      "a predominance of what we call leather-colors, with a considerable\n",
      "mixture of certain shades of red that are peculiar to the oak. We rarely\n",
      "find pure yellow or scarlet leaves in the foliage of any species of oak.\n",
      "The color of the scarlet oak is nearer a purple or crimson than any\n",
      "other shade of red. The white oak turns, with but little variation, to\n",
      "an ashen-purple or impure violet. The black and red oaks display varying\n",
      "and imperfect shades of drab and orange. The oaks are remarkable for the\n",
      "persistence of their foliage, and for the duration of their tints, which\n",
      "are chiefly the brown and russet of dead leaves with a lively polish.\n",
      "Long after other deciduous trees have become leafless, the various\n",
      "sombre shades of the different oaks cast a melancholy tinge over the\n",
      "waning beauty of the forest.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are wont to speak of trees as the principal objects of admiration in\n",
      "autumnal scenery, but the shrubs, though less conspicuous on account of\n",
      "their inferior size, are not less brilliant. It is also remarkable that\n",
      "reds predominate in the shrubbery, and yellows in the trees. Reds and\n",
      "purples distinguish the whortleberry, the cornel, the viburnum, and the\n",
      "sumach, including all their species. There is indeed so small a\n",
      "proportion of yellow in the shrubbery, that it is hardly distinguishable\n",
      "in the general mass of scarlet, crimson, and purple. Among trees, on the\n",
      "contrary, yellows prevail in all miscellaneous woods. They distinguish\n",
      "the poplar, the birch, the hickory, the tulip-tree, the elm, and a good\n",
      "proportion of the maples. It ought to be remarked, however, that there\n",
      "are more shrubs than trees that do not change materially, but remain\n",
      "green until the fall of their leaves. The alder remains green; and as it\n",
      "covers a large proportion of our wet grounds, it might seem to an\n",
      "observer in those situations that the tints of autumn were confined to\n",
      "the trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many persons still believe frost to be the great limner of the foliage,\n",
      "as if it were a sort of dyeing material. On the contrary, the slightest\n",
      "frost will destroy the tints of every leaf that is touched by it. It is\n",
      "not uncommon to witness a general tarnishing of the autumnal tints by\n",
      "frost as early as September. In some years they are spoiled by it before\n",
      "they have begun to be developed. An autumn rarely passes when the colors\n",
      "of the foliage are not half ruined before the time when they ought to be\n",
      "in their brightest condition. But the injury they receive from slight\n",
      "frosts is not apparent to careless observation. In the meridian of their\n",
      "beauty, heat will damage the tints as badly as frost. A very hot and\n",
      "sunny day occurring the first or second week of October makes almost as\n",
      "much havoc with the ash and the maple as a freezing night, fading their\n",
      "leaves rapidly and loosening their attachment to the branches, so that\n",
      "the slightest wind will scatter them to the ground. Yet the action of\n",
      "heat differs materially from that of frost. Frost imbrowns and crisps or\n",
      "sears the leaves, while heat only fades them to lighter and more\n",
      "indefinite shades. Frost is destructive of their colors, heat is only a\n",
      "bleaching agent. Cool weather in autumn without frost is necessary for\n",
      "the preservation of its seasonal beauty.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most brilliant autumnal hues appear after a wet summer, followed by\n",
      "a cool autumn, unattended with frost. Cool weather preserves not only\n",
      "the purity of the colors, but also the persistence of the foliage. If\n",
      "the early frosts are delayed, the tints are brighter for this delay\n",
      "while the weather remains cool. But a wet summer is so generally\n",
      "followed by premature cold, that the finest displays of autumn scenery\n",
      "are often suddenly ruined by a hard frost. Seldom are all the favorable\n",
      "circumstances for preserving the purity of the tints combined in any one\n",
      "season. Not more than once in six or eight years are both heat and frost\n",

      "tremulous habit of the foliage, but is never assembled in large forest\n",
      "groups. Like the alder, it is employed by Nature for the shading of her\n",

      "mischievous character of their operations of smoothing and grubbing.\n",
      "That little rising ground you see before you, covered with trees and\n",
      "shrubs, is hardly more than a bare rock. It occupies about an eighth of\n",
      "an acre; but no other possible use could be made of it, except as a\n",
      "quarry. The little grove, or coppice, that stands upon it, is the most\n",
      "beautiful object in sight from my house. I have never allowed it to be\n",
      "disturbed or frequented by social assemblages. I keep it sacred for the\n",
      "use of the birds, and it is a perfect aviary. The birds that feed upon\n",
      "the destructive insects that infest my grounds are raised in that temple\n",
      "of the gods, which is watered by numerous little springs that ooze from\n",
      "the crevices of the rock. While they are rearing their young, all\n",
      "species, even if they live exclusively upon seeds after they have left\n",
      "their nest, feed their offspring upon larvÃ¦, which they collect from the\n",
      "nearest ground that affords them a supply. Hence I consider that bare\n",
      "rock, with its trees and shrubbery, the most profitable division of my\n",
      "farm, from the shelter it affords the birds, which are in an important\n",
      "sense my most profitable stock.â€\n",
      "\n",
      "I have often thought of my neighborâ€™s remarks, especially when I have\n",
      "observed the diligence of our farmers in destroying upon their grounds\n",
      "every acceptable harbor for the birds. When we are traversing a wood, if\n",
      "we discover an apple-tree growing in a little clearing or open space, we\n",
      "find it invariably exempt from the ravages of the common apple-borer.\n",
      "The same exemption is observed in those fruit-trees that stand very near\n",
      "a wild wood, or any wood containing a spontaneous undergrowth. The\n",
      "explanation of this fact is that the wood affords a harbor to the birds\n",
      "that destroy these insects in all their forms. Orchards and gardens, on\n",
      "the contrary, which are located at any considerable distance from a\n",
      "wood, have not this security. Robins, it is true, are very abundant in\n",
      "orchards, which are their breeding-places; but robins, though the most\n",
      "useful birds that are known to exist, take all their food from the\n",
      "ground. They destroy vast quantities of cutworms and chrysalids buried\n",
      "in the soil, but they take no part of their insect food from the trees.\n",
      "The birds that perform this work are the sylvias, woodpeckers, creepers,\n",
      "and other species that live only in woods and thickets. Hence an orchard\n",
      "that is nearly surrounded by a wild wood of much extent is not badly\n",
      "infested by borers and other injurious insects.\n",
      "\n",
      "All species of insects multiply in cultivated grounds, while the birds,\n",
      "with a few exceptions, that feed upon them, can find a nursery and\n",
      "protection only in the woods. â€œThe locust,â€ says George P. Marsh, â€œwhich\n",
      "ravages the East with its voracious armies, is bred in vast open plains,\n",
      "which admit the full heat of the sun to hasten the hatching of the eggs,\n",
      "gather no moisture to destroy them, _and harbor no bird to feed upon\n",
      "their larvÃ¦_. It is only since the felling of the forests of Asia Minor\n",
      "and Cyrene that the locust has become so fearfully destructive in those\n",
      "countries; and the grasshopper, which now threatens to be almost as\n",
      "great a pest to the agriculture of North American soils, breeds in\n",
      "seriously injurious numbers only where a wide extent of surface is bare\n",
      "of woods.â€\n",
      "\n",
      "Some men destroy trees and shrubbery in their borders, because they are\n",
      "supposed to harbor insects. But if this be true, it is because they are\n",
      "not sufficient in extent to shelter the birds that feed upon them. The\n",
      "insects that multiply upon our lands deposit their eggs some in the\n",
      "soil, some on the branches of trees and upon fences and buildings. They\n",
      "are nowise dependent on a wild growth of wood and shrubbery. These pests\n",
      "of agriculture need nothing better than the under edge of a clapboard or\n",
      "a shingle whereon to suspend their cocoons or lay their eggs. So minute\n",
      "are the objects that will afford them all the conveniences they need,\n",
      "when hatching and when passing through all their transformations, till\n",
      "they become perfect insects, that no artifice or industry of man can\n",
      "deprive them of their nurseries, or appreciably lessen their numbers.\n",
      "All inventions and appliances used to rid the trees and grounds of these\n",
      "pests never destroyed more than one in a million of their whole number.\n",
      "It is not in the power of man, with all his science, unassisted by\n",
      "birds, to prevent the multiplication of insects from being the cause of\n",
      "his own annihilation. But the farmer, when he destroys the border\n",
      "shrubbery in his fields and the coppice and wood on his hills,\n",
      "exterminates the birds by hosts, while the mischievous boy with his gun\n",
      "destroys only a few individuals. The clipped hedge-row, which is often\n",
      "substituted for a border of wild shrubbery, may assist in breeding\n",
      "insects; but the birds never build their nests in a hedge-row, unless it\n",
      "be a long-neglected one.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have in another essay spoken of the scarcity of birds and other\n",
      "animals in the primitive forest. They are not numerous there, because\n",
      "the forest would yield them only a scanty subsistence. The forest border\n",
      "is their nursery and their shelter, but their best feeding-places are\n",
      "the cultivated grounds. There is not a single species whose means of\n",
      "subsistence are not increased by the clearing of the forest and the\n",
      "cultivation of the land; but they require a certain proportion of wild\n",
      "wood for their habitation. Very few species build their nests in the\n",
      "trees and shrubbery of our gardens, unless they are near a wood. In that\n",
      "case the catbird often nestles in the garden, that during the rearing of\n",
      "its young it may be near the grounds that produce larvÃ¦. Most of the\n",
      "woodpeckers, the sylvias, and the small thrushes, including some of our\n",
      "most valuable birds, cannot rear their young except in a wild wood. Yet\n",
      "all these, solitary as they are in their habits, increase under\n",
      "favorable circumstances with the multiplication of insects consequent\n",
      "upon the culture of the soil. It may be affirmed as an indisputable\n",
      "truth, that if their increase were not checked by the sporting habits of\n",
      "men and boys, and the clearing and grubbing habits of â€œmodel farmers,â€\n",
      "birds of every species would increase in the same ratio with the\n",

      "It has been observed that a meadow covered with luxuriant grass and\n",

      "than a similar meadow covered with a scanty herbage. The moisture\n",
      "exhaled into the air by vegetable perspiration is greater than from any\n",
      "other natural surface; and as the radiation of heat is rapid in\n",
      "proportion to the moist condition of the atmosphere, the cooling process\n",
      "over a grassy meadow is vastly greater than over a similar ground bare\n",
      "of vegetation. A wood, in like manner, by exhaling through its foliage\n",
      "the moisture it draws from the earth, cools the atmosphere in proportion\n",
      "to the amount of its foliage, while at the same time it shades the\n",
      "ground from the sun. Anything that should check this vegetable\n",
      "perspiration would in the same ratio preserve the heat of the atmosphere\n",
      "by diminishing the radiation of heat that takes place more slowly in dry\n",

      "\n",
      "A writer in â€œSillimanâ€™s Journalâ€ of 1833, who advances a very different\n",
      "theory to explain this phenomenon, makes a statement that favors my\n",
      "view: â€œIt appears to us that the existence and duration of the Indian\n",
      "Summer in this country has an important connection with the extensive\n",
      "forests and uncultivated lands peculiar to America. And it is worthy of\n",
      "remark, that, according to the recollection of the oldest of our\n",
      "inhabitants, its former duration was often three or four weeks; whereas\n",
      "its present continuance is short and uncertain, seldom exceeding ten or\n",
      "fifteen days. It appears also that this decline has been somewhat\n",

      "uncovering of the country.â€\n",

      "It is surprising that the writer, after making these observations,\n",
      "should resort to some unintelligible reasoning about the trade-winds,\n",
      "and certain assumed electric phenomena, to account for the Indian\n",
      "Summer. I can easily believe that before the encroachments upon the\n",
      "American forest were very extensive, this halcyon period of autumn may\n",
      "have occurred every year with great regularity. But since the clearing\n",
      "is almost universal, these conditions have been entirely changed. During\n",
      "the primitive state of the forest, its sudden denudation produced a more\n",
      "complete revolution on the face of the country than could possibly\n",
      "happen at the present time. The clearing of the woods has also cast down\n",
      "the barriers that impeded the circulation of the winds; at present these\n",
      "winds, sweeping freely over the continent, would counteract any\n",
      "influences, whatever they might be, that would produce an Indian Summer\n",

      "The true Indian Summer was a period of very mild weather, lasting from\n",
      "ten to fifteen days, and accompanied neither by wind nor rain. It has\n",
      "been incorrectly described by certain writers as attended with fog. The\n",
      "sky, though somewhat dim, was not obscured by vapor, but by a sort of\n",
      "ruddy haze, that veiled the prospect, as it often will during a series\n",
      "of warm, still days happening at any season. I draw my inferences from\n",
      "what I have reason to consider the most authentic accounts. The air was\n",
      "dry; and it could not have been otherwise. If it were moist, the\n",
      "increased radiation would soon dissipate the heat and put an end to the\n",
      "Indian Summer, which was never known to survive a copious and extensive\n",
      "fall of rain. The atmosphere was described as being obscured by smoke,\n",
      "rather than vapor, and this was most apparent in the latter part of the\n",
      "day. This smoky atmosphere has led some writers to suppose the whole\n",
      "phenomenon to be caused by fires in the woods.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to tradition, no part of the year was more delightful than\n",
      "this short period. Those accounts, however, that extended its duration\n",
      "beyond the space of fourteen or fifteen days were undoubtedly\n",
      "exaggerated. The nearest approaches to an Indian Summer which I have\n",
      "witnessed in its proper season have never lasted a week. In our day,\n",
      "when a warm week occurs in the autumn, it comes at no regular or\n",

      "to be identified as the Indian Summer, which was regular in its\n",
      "happening immediately after the entire denudation of the forest. Similar\n",
      "but shorter periods of mild and serene weather may happen, at the\n",
      "present epoch, in winter and spring as well as in autumn. These\n",

      "â€œThe earliest chant,â€ says Momsen, â€œin the view of the Romans, was that\n",
      "which the trees sang to themselves, in the green solitudes of the\n",
      "forest. The whisperings and pipings of the _favorable spirit_ in the\n",
      "grove were repeated by the singer, with the accompaniment of the pipe.â€\n",
      "Certain trees belonging to the sacred groves gave oracular sounds, which\n",
      "were interpreted by musicians, and received by all men with faith and\n",
      "reverence. From the earliest ages men have listened to sounds from trees\n",
      "as music and as the voice of some deity, affording auguries of future\n",
      "events; for, as they reasoned, if a deity speaks to us, what sounds\n",
      "would be a more appropriate medium of communication than those of the\n",
      "trees which formed their temples and their altars? The sanctity\n",
      "attributed to certain groves by the ancients was probably owing to some\n",

      "impressiveness of their assemblages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every tree, when swept by the winds, gives a sound in harmony with the\n",
      "character of its leaves and spray. The sounds from the lofty branches of\n",
      "firs and pines remind the listener of the murmuring of waters, and\n",
      "inspire the most agreeable sensations. How often have I sat under the\n",
      "shade of a pine wood, and listened to the fancied roaring of the distant\n",
      "waves of the sea, as the winds passed through their foliage. When the\n",
      "breeze commences, we hear the first soft rippling of the waves; as it\n",
      "increases, succeeding waves of fuller swell flow tremulously upon the\n",
      "strand, and as the wind subsides melt into silence as they recede from\n",
      "the shore. Other trees produce very different sounds. The colors of\n",
      "their leaves, and the glittering lights from their more or less\n",
      "refractive surfaces, do not differ more than the modifications of sound\n",
      "drawn from them by the passing winds. Every tree is a delicate musical\n",

      "produce feelings awakened by no other situation. It is in the deep\n",

      "From the earliest period of history, mankind have looked upon trees and\n",
      "woods with veneration, regarding them as special gifts of the gods to\n",
      "the human race. The ancient priests and philosophers used them as their\n",
      "places of retirement, both for the study of wisdom and the services of\n",
      "religion. Hence arose that early custom of planting trees in circles,\n",
      "forming a kind of amphitheatre, for religious assemblies. The teachers\n",
      "of philosophy used the same circular groves. These were held in the\n",
      "greatest reverence; and no man dared to commit the sacrilegious act of\n",
      "cutting down any part of them or defacing any of the trees. By means of\n",
      "these circular groves, wise and holy men obtained that seclusion and\n",
      "quiet which it was not easy to find in towns and cities. They were both\n",
      "schools and chapels, devoted to religion and philosophy. Hence the\n",
      "often-quoted remark of Pliny that â€œthe groves were the first temples of\n",
      "the gods.â€\n",

      "It is not improbable that many of the ancient superstitions relating to\n",
      "trees and groves originated with wise men, who believed that such holy\n",
      "fears alone would restrain the people from devastating the whole earth\n",
      "by the destruction of trees. Science now supplies mankind with rational\n",
      "motives for their preservation, in place of the religious scruples of\n",

      "including even invading armies, whose chiefs, while respecting neither\n",
      "the lives nor the property of the enemy, held these consecrated groves\n",
      "sacred and inviolable. Hunting was forbidden within them by this\n",

      "divert attention from winter, as entirely disagreeable, except within\n",
      "doors, than to lure the mind to its attractions. Its features have been\n",
      "described as only waste and desolate, and what is really admirable in\n",
      "them has been set aside as hardly worthy of thought. It is true there is\n",
      "not much variety in the countenance of winter. Its expressions are wild\n",
      "and rude, and partake more of sublimity than beauty. It presents an\n",
      "insufficient number of individual objects that can be brought to the aid\n",
      "either of painting or poetry; so that the composition must be made up in\n",
      "great degree by auxiliaries drawn from the imagination.\n",

      "Winter scenery is plainly monotonous. Instead of the charming mosaic of\n",
      "agriculture, displayed by summer and autumn in assemblages of fields,\n",
      "varying in color with the native hue of their different crops, we see\n",
      "either a dull universal waste of seared vegetation, or one broad expanse\n",
      "of whiteness, relieved only by the dark slender lines of fences and the\n",
      "broader stripes of roads and lanes winding over the face of the snow,\n",
      "interspersed with buildings and occasional woods and thickets. It is\n",
      "apparent, however, that snow increases the variety of the landscape,\n",
      "when it is mapped out with groves and fragments of forest, resembling\n",
      "wooded islets rising out of a white sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "The charm of winter scenery is greatly heightened by the clearing of the\n",
      "forest, which hides the surface of the snow and causes the scene to wear\n",
      "less of the aspect of grandeur than of desolation. Grandeur\n",
      "characterizes the view wherever an almost uninterrupted expanse of some\n",
      "miles of surface is completely whitened with snow. The buoyancy we feel\n",
      "when rambling over such a landscape resembles that produced by great\n",
      "altitude. Our greater physical vigor in clear winter weather prepares us\n",
      "to be agreeably affected by surrounding views, because our thoughts are\n",
      "not diverted by any sense of uncomfortable exertion, as in the languid\n",
      "heat of summer. Our constant transition from valley to open plain, from\n",
      "plain to hill, and from hill to wood, keeps the mind constantly amused\n",
      "with new views. We are also inspired by the grandeur of the whole scene,\n",
      "and do not, as in summer, give ourselves up to voluptuous sensations,\n",
      "but to enjoyments more purely intellectual.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our attention is not so often directed to the beauty of trees in their\n",
      "denuded state, as when they are dressed in foliage and adorned with\n",
      "flowers and fruit. But when we consider that for six months of the year\n",
      "all the deciduous trees, constituting the greater part of the woods, are\n",
      "leafless, we cannot regard their appearance at this time as an\n",
      "unimportant study. When trees are in leaf their primary qualities as\n",
      "objects in landscape are apparent; but many secondary points of beauty\n",
      "are almost entirely hidden under this mass of foliage. In winter, when\n",
      "the whole frame of the tree is exposed to view, the delicate sculpture,\n",
      "the forms, the angles, and the divergences of their branches, present to\n",
      "sight an infinite variety of picturesque appearances.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are certain trees, however, which are almost ugly in winter,\n",
      "though very beautiful in their summer dress. We see nothing attractive\n",
      "in the horse-chestnut, the sumach, the catalpa, and the ash, in their\n",
      "denuded state, when the coarseness and deformity of their spray become\n",
      "their salient points. Of these the horse-chestnut and the catalpa are\n",
      "not surpassed in beauty when they are in flower, nor the sumach in its\n",
      "autumnal dress, nor the ash either in summer or autumn. There is as\n",
      "great a variety in the style of the frame and framework of different\n",
      "trees as in the forms and colors of their leaves and flowers. Indeed, in\n",
      "some respects, trees are a more interesting study in their denuded state\n",
      "than when dressed in foliage. In this condition single trees become more\n",
      "special objects of attention than assemblages. Yet it is in winter that\n",
      "we perceive to the best advantage the characters of a forest vista. As\n",
      "we pass under the interlacing branches of the trees, we observe that\n",
      "peculiar arch formed by the meeting and contact of those on opposite\n",
      "sides of an avenue. We see this appearance only in a wide avenue, where\n",
      "the trees have grown since it was laid out. In the pathless wood, or in\n",
      "a path made through the forest after the trees have attained maturity,\n",
      "they have no well-formed lateral branches, and display above our heads\n",
      "only a formless canopy.\n",
      "\n",
      "We may observe in the spray of different trees an invariable\n",
      "correspondence with some of their other characters. Nut-bearers, for\n",
      "example, have a coarser spray than small seed-bearers; trees with large\n",
      "or compound leaves, than those with small or simple foliage; and trees\n",
      "with opposite, than those with alternate branches. Hence the oak and the\n",
      "hickory have a coarser spray than the birch and the elm, and the\n",
      "large-leaved poplar than the slender-leaved willow; the ash, with\n",
      "compound leaves, than the maple with simple leaves, though both have\n",
      "opposite branches. But if a tree bears a large nut, with leaves compound\n",
      "and branches opposite, like the horse-chestnut, it has no spray at all.\n",
      "The beech-tree, however, having a very small nut, has a fine and elegant\n",
      "spray, not surpassed by any tree of the forest. The opposite character\n",
      "of the smaller branches of certain trees is never continued in the\n",
      "larger divisions. But the angularity of the boughs of the oak is\n",
      "repeated in its angular spray, and the gracefulness of the principal\n",
      "branches of the elm, the birch, and the lime is traced through all their\n",
      "minute subdivisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "All these phenomena are interesting subjects of observation in winter\n",
      "wood-scenery. But the geometric beauty of the spray of trees is hardly\n",
      "less remarkable than its different colors. A maple wood, for example, is\n",
      "gray; a poplar wood is greenish olive; a wood consisting chiefly of\n",
      "limes, black birches, and cherry-trees has a dark shade. These\n",
      "differences of coloring, as seen in masses, when viewing the wood from\n",
      "an elevated stand, often excite the surprise of spectators; for it is\n",
      "only the most careful observers who have noticed this variety of shades.\n",
      "In many assemblages of wood that consist of an evenly promiscuous\n",
      "combination of species, we observe no such picturesque marks of\n",
      "distinction. But in all unique assemblages, of which our land affords\n",
      "very frequent examples, the differences between a maple, a poplar, a\n",
      "willow, and a lime grove are respectively very striking. The study of\n",
      "these shades is of considerable importance to the painter who should\n",
      "wish to give a true representation of a winter landscape, with reference\n",
      "chiefly to its wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of my most delightful wood rambles have been taken in the winter,\n",
      "which has always seemed to me less a season of melancholy than autumn.\n",
      "The sadness we feel while the leaves are falling around us and the light\n",
      "of noon seems but an ominous twilight passes away after these changes\n",
      "are completed; we resume our cheerfulness, and look forward in pleasant\n",
      "anticipation of spring. I have never allowed the winter to interfere\n",
      "with my rambling, save when the cold was intense, the weather wet or\n",
      "stormy, or the snow too deep for pedestrian excursions. These\n",
      "difficulties are seldom in the way for more than a fourth part of the\n",
      "season. When the snow has been hardened by repeated freezing and thawing\n",
      "so as to bear our footsteps, or when the ground is bare, a winter walk\n",
      "affords positive pleasure. At such times I have often passed a day in\n",
      "the woods, not only to enjoy the physical pleasure of air and exercise\n",
      "and the sweet odors of the pines, but also to note the changes in the\n",
      "face of nature, and the manners and habits of the few remaining birds\n",
      "and quadrupeds.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most noted circumstances attending a winter ramble in the\n",
      "woods is their silence. But this silence is an aid to thought as well as\n",
      "observation, and gives importance to every sound, as the white snow\n",
      "gives prominence to visual objects. When the winter sun is bright and\n",
      "the chilly atmosphere is calm, we may listen to the distant village hum\n",
      "with a sensation of melody; and we catch the gurgling sounds of streams\n",
      "under the glistening ice, and the voices of jubilant echoes, that send\n",
      "back in the general stillness every sound that penetrates their secret\n",
      "shell. The crumpling of the hardened snow under our feet produces a tone\n",
      "that silence alone could turn to music; and the rustling of every zephyr\n",
      "seems like a living note in this solitude. The occasional voices of\n",
      "winter birds have a charm hardly less delightful than the melodies of\n",
      "June, when every note is but the part of a general chorus. In winter we\n",
      "listen to sounds because they are few. Even the lowing of herds is\n",
      "musical, reminding us that our present solitude is encompassed by life\n",
      "and civilization.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wood is no longer a green recess, a temple of leafy beauty, a\n",
      "sanctuary of shade, an orchestra of melodious voices. There is perhaps\n",
      "less solemnity within it than when it is darkened by overarching\n",
      "foliage. The sun shines into it and renders some little nooks more\n",
      "cheerful than at any other season. I have often lingered in one of these\n",
      "sunny retreats to watch the chickadees and woodpeckers, that never fail\n",
      "to appear in sight, diligently exploring every branch of the neighboring\n",
      "trees. It is pleasant to woo this solitude when thus enlivened by the\n",
      "sun, to saunter along the turfy wood-paths, still green with clumps of\n",
      "moss and lycopodium, to look up into the lofty trees which have parted\n",
      "with their shade, observing the sculptured elegance of their limbs and\n",
      "the intricate beauty of their spray; pondering on the rare carvings of\n",
      "their bark, broken into many geometrical forms, and the curious devices\n",
      "of nature displayed in the incrustations upon their surface.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Larch, though one of the coniferous trees, is not an evergreen. It\n",
      "is generally known in this country as the Hacmatack, a name given it by\n",
      "the Indians. In favorable situations it attains a great height, though\n",
      "we are familiar with it as a tree of but ordinary size and stature. Its\n",
      "branches are very numerous, and irregularly disposed at right angles\n",
      "with the main stem, and not in very apparent whorls. The terminal\n",
      "branches are small and numerous, making considerable spray, but without\n",
      "much character. The American and the European Larch do not differ in\n",
      "their manner of putting forth their larger branches, nor in their\n",
      "botanical characters. They are distinguished, however, by an important\n",
      "difference in the style of their secondary branches. The European tree\n",
      "has a graceful hanging spray, drooping perpendicularly from its\n",
      "horizontal boughs, and swinging in the wind like that of the Norway\n",
      "spruce. The American tree has a shorter spray, not in the least pendent,\n",
      "with an appearance of more sturdiness, and less formality of outline. It\n",
      "displays, therefore, less of that beauty which is caused by flowing\n",
      "lines; on the other hand, it exhibits more firmness in its general\n",
      "aspect, and is a more stately tree. I prefer the American Larch because\n",
      "it departs further from that primness which distinguishes the coniferous\n",
      "trees. As it increases in height, it loses its tapering summit, and\n",
      "forms a head of flattened and irregular shape.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Larch bears no part in romantic history. Neither the ancient poets\n",
      "nor historians say much about it. Hence it is probable that it was not\n",
      "abundant in the forests of the southern part of Europe in the days of\n",
      "Homer and Virgil. Even its importance in furnishing the most durable\n",
      "wood for naval purposes is a discovery of modern times, and not until a\n",
      "very late period was it employed as an ornamental tree. The Larch is\n",
      "reputed in Europe to surpass all other trees as a fertilizer of the soil\n",
      "by the decomposition of its foliage. Another of its advantages, when\n",
      "used for plantations, is its thrifty habit on lofty sites, having a more\n",
      "elevated range than any other tree of equal importance. Gilpin remarks\n",
      "of the European tree: â€œIt claims the Alps and the Apennines for its\n",
      "native country, where it thrives in higher regions of the air than any\n",
      "other tree of its consequence is known to do, hanging over rocks and\n",
      "precipices which have never been visited by human feet. Often it is\n",
      "felled by some Alpine peasant and thrown athwart some yawning chasm,\n",
      "where it affords a tremendous passage from cliff to cliff, while the\n",
      "cataract, roaring many fathoms below, is seen only in surges of rising\n",
      "vapor.â€\n",
      "\n",
      "The American Larch tends to uniformity of shape when young and to\n",
      "variety when old. Yet the fine pyramidal forms of the young trees, and\n",
      "the fantastic and irregular shapes of those of older growth, are equally\n",
      "characteristic. The foliage is of a light green with a bluish tinge,\n",
      "turning to a deep orange in November, just before it falls. The bright\n",
      "crimson cones of the Larch, that appear in June, may be reckoned among\n",
      "its minor beauties. This tree is more abundant in Maine and New\n",
      "Hampshire than in any other part of the United States, though even there\n",
      "it is scarce compared with other conifers. Above the St. Lawrence,\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hemlock is confessedly one of the most beautiful of the coniferous\n",
      "evergreens, though rather narrow in its dimensions. The principal\n",
      "branches are small and short with very slender terminations, in which it\n",
      "differs from all the other spruces. The multitude of these slender\n",
      "sprays, and their rows of soft delicate leaves, cause those beautiful\n",
      "undulations that characterize the foliage of this tree when moved by the\n",
      "wind. The leaves, of a light green on their upper surface and of a\n",
      "silvery whiteness beneath, are arranged in a row on each side of the\n",
      "branchlets. But while those of the other spruces are sessile, those of\n",
      "the Hemlock have slender footstalks, yielding them a slight mobility.\n",
      "The spangled glitter of the foliage is caused by a slightly tremulous\n",
      "motion of the terminal sprays.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a deep wood the Hemlock shows some very important defects. There it\n",
      "forms a shaft from fifty to eighty feet in height without any diminution\n",
      "of its size, until near the summit, where it tapers suddenly, forming a\n",
      "head of foliage that projects considerably above the general level of\n",
      "the forest. The trunk is covered with dead branches projecting from it\n",
      "on all sides, causing it to wear a very unsightly appearance; and when\n",
      "the tree is sawed into boards, they are found to extend directly through\n",
      "the sapwood of the tree, making a hole in it as round as if it were\n",
      "bored with an auger. This is caused by the continued growth of the trunk\n",
      "of the tree after the decay of its branches, every year forming a new\n",
      "circle round the branch, but not inosculating with it, as in other\n",
      "trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "The full beauty of the Hemlock is displayed on the edge of a wood, or on\n",
      "a plain where it has grown without impediment, feathering down to the\n",
      "ground. Here we observe how much less formal it is in shape than other\n",
      "conifers. When there are no gaps in its ramification, the numerous\n",
      "branches are mostly in close contact at their extremities, so that, when\n",
      "viewed from the outside of the wood, it seems nearly one uninterrupted\n",
      "mass of foliage, hiding the interior of the tree almost entirely from\n",
      "sight. In its perfection, when it has enjoyed an isolated growth,\n",
      "without any mechanical accident to mar its symmetry, it presents a fine\n",
      "tapering form without stiffness, and a mass of glittering foliage with\n",
      "which that of but few other trees is comparable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The branches of the Hemlock are very numerous, perfectly horizontal, and\n",
      "remarkable for the absence of those regular whorls that distinguish\n",
      "other trees of this genus. They are put forth irregularly from all parts\n",
      "of the trunk, turning from their horizontal position gracefully upward,\n",
      "drooping a little at their termination, and endowed with great\n",
      "flexibility. The branches are minutely subdivided, forming with their\n",
      "leaves a flat surface, somewhat like the compound pinnate leaves of the\n",
      "cicuta, or poison hemlock. From this resemblance it undoubtedly obtained\n",
      "its name. These branches lie one above another, each bending over at its\n",
      "extremities upon the surface of those below, like the feathers upon the\n",
      "wings of a bird.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bark of the Hemlock is of a reddish brown, divided by furrows that\n",
      "separate it into scales. The young trees have a smooth bark, like that\n",
      "of the balsam fir. The cones are very small, numerous, and pendent, of a\n",
      "fine crimson color when they first appear, attached to the ends of the\n",
      "branches, and arriving at maturity in the autumn. The Hemlock occupies\n",
      "all kinds of soil, though trees of a large size are found only where it\n",
      "is deep and fertile. It is fond of moisture, often extending its\n",
      "graceful boughs from the summits of granitic rocks and declivities wet\n",
      "with perpetual springs. â€œThe Hemlock is natural to the coldest regions\n",
      "of America, and begins to appear about Hudsonâ€™s Bay, near Lake St. John;\n",
      "in the neighborhood of Quebec it fills the forests, and in Nova Scotia,\n",
      "New Brunswick, the States of Maine and Vermont, and a considerable part\n",
      "of New Hampshire, it constitutes three fourths of the evergreen woods.\n",

      "was injurious to human life; the emblem of faith, because its heart is\n",

      "diseases, and a magic charm which was thrown on the funeral pile to\n",
      "protect the spirit of the dead from evil, and bound with the leaves to\n",
      "propitiate the deities by their incense. It is not improbable that the\n",
      "superstitious notions respecting the power of its fruit to heal diseases\n",
      "gave origin to the use of it in the manufacture of certain alcoholic\n",
      "liquors; and it is a remarkable fact that universal belief in its\n",
      "virtues as a panacea should have attached to a plant which is now used\n",
      "for no important medical purpose whatever save the flavoring of gin!\n",
      "\n",
      "The Juniper, very generally called the Red Cedar, and known in many\n",
      "places as the Savin, is well known to all our people, and is associated\n",
      "with the most rugged scenery of our coast. On all our rocky hills which\n",
      "have been stripped of their original growth the Juniper springs up as if\n",
      "it found there a soil congenial to its wants. On the contrary, the soil\n",
      "is very poorly adapted to it, for the tree never attains a good size in\n",
      "these situations. Its presence there may be attributed to the birds that\n",
      "feed in winter upon its fruit, and scatter its seeds while in quest of\n",
      "dormant insects among the sods. As we journey southward, we find this\n",
      "tree in perfection in New Jersey and Maryland; and in all the Atlantic\n",

      "variety of shapes and grotesque peculiarities of outline. Yet the normal\n",
      "shape of this tree is a perfect spire. When it presents this form, it\n",
      "is, in the true sense of the word, a beautiful object. Even its\n",
      "rusty-green foliage gives variety to the hues of the landscape, and\n",
      "heightens by contrast the verdure of other trees. This effect is the\n",
      "more remarkable at midsummer, when the green of the different trees has\n",

      "foliage resembling that of the prostrate Juniper, as if a branch of that\n",
      "shrub had been ingrafted upon it. The berries, which are abundant in the\n",
      "fertile trees, are of a light bluish color, and afford a winter repast\n",

      "observe in a symmetrical fir. Their leaves are longer, and their\n",
      "branches not so regularly given out in whorls. They are also more\n",
      "generally round-headed when old; their leaves are in small fascicles,\n",
      "containing from two to five, while those of the fir are arranged singly\n",

      "bearing its leaves in fives. The White Pine, according to Michaux, â€œis\n",
      "the loftiest and most valuable of the productions of the North American\n",
      "forest. Its summit is seen at an immense distance, aspiring to heaven,\n",

      "shelter, in its wide-spread, horizontal branches, and in its silken\n",
      "tufted foliage. It is not impenetrable to sunshine, but admits it in\n",
      "constant flickering beams of light; and we perceive immediately that\n",
      "there is no other tree in whose shade it would be more agreeable to\n",
      "recline on a hot summerâ€™s day, or under whose protection we might obtain\n",
      "a greater amount of comfort in winter. The uniform arrangement of its\n",
      "branches in whorls, forming a series of stages one above another, its\n",
      "tasselled foliage in long, silky tufts at the ends of the branches, and\n",
      "its symmetrical outline, constitute in the most obvious sense a\n",
      "beautiful tree. These tufts, though not pendulous, have none of the\n",
      "stiff bristling appearance of the other pines; and their verdure is of a\n",
      "sober, not a sombre tint, though rather dull in lustre.\n",

      "which grandeur could not be produced without symmetry. This tree has\n",
      "much of the amplitude so remarkable in the cedar of Lebanon. Hence the\n",
      "look of primness, which the firs always retain, is counteracted by its\n",
      "nobleness and altitude. It is combined also with a certain negligent\n",

      "pastoral meadow. It gives a darker frown to the projecting cliff, and a\n",
      "more awful uncertainty to the mountain pass or the craggy ravine. Over\n",
      "desolate scenery it spreads a cheerfulness that detracts nothing from\n",
      "its power over the imagination, while it relieves it of its terrors, by\n",

      "and repose. The squirrel feeds upon the kernels obtained from its cones;\n",
      "the hare browses upon the trefoil and the spicy foliage of the\n",
      "hypericum, which are protected in its shade, and the fawn reposes on its\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Pitch Pine differs very widely in its style of growth from the white\n",
      "pine, and displays fewer of those points that excite our admiration. Its\n",
      "leaves form larger and more diffusive tufts, and are more bristling and\n",
      "erect from their superior rigidity. It is remarkable for its rough and\n",
      "shaggy appearance; hence its Latin name, _rigida_. Indeed there is not a\n",
      "tree in our forest that equals it in the roughness that is manifest in\n",
      "every part of it and in every stage of its growth. This is one of the\n",
      "most common trees in the Southern â€œpine barrensâ€; and some of the\n",
      "ancient pine woods in New England were made up principally of this\n",
      "species. Such was that extensive wood near Concord, N. H., known by the\n",
      "poetic appellation of â€œDark Plains,â€ and in the early part of the\n",
      "century occupying a wide flat region in the valley of the Merrimack\n",
      "River.\n",
      "\n",
      "This species does not give out its branches horizontally, nor in regular\n",
      "whorls. They run up at rather a wide angle with the stem, forming a head\n",
      "that approaches more nearly to a globular shape than that of any other\n",
      "of the American conifers. The branches have frequently a tortuous shape;\n",
      "for when crowded in a dense wood they do not so easily perish as those\n",
      "of the white pine, but turn in various directions to find light and\n",
      "space. They are likewise often bent downwards at their terminations,\n",
      "with a very apparent curvature. There is no conifer that displays so few\n",
      "straight lines in its composition; and, having no exact symmetry in its\n",
      "proportions, it may be mutilated to a considerable extent without losing\n",
      "its normal characters of beauty.\n",
      "\n",
      "In young trees of this species the whorls of branches may be plainly\n",
      "distinguished; but as the tree increases in size, so many members of the\n",
      "whorl become abortive that all regularity of staging in their\n",
      "arrangement is destroyed. As these branches are numerous, with but\n",
      "little space between the original whorls, they seem to project from\n",
      "every part of the trunk. This tree displays very little primness in its\n",
      "shape, or of a spiry form, save when it is a very young tree. A peculiar\n",
      "habit of the Pitch Pine is that of producing little branchlets full of\n",
      "leaves along the stem from the root upwards, completely enveloping some\n",
      "of the principal boughs. These are rarely anything more than tufts of\n",
      "leaves standing out as if they had been grafted into the bark of the\n",
      "tree. It seems to be stimulated to produce this anomalous growth by the\n",
      "loss of its small branches. It then soon covers itself with this\n",
      "embroidery, and thus garlanded presents a picturesque appearance more\n",
      "interesting than that of the perfect trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have seen very beautiful Pitch Pine trees of an abnormal shape, caused\n",
      "by the loss, when young, of the leading shoot. The lateral branches next\n",
      "below this terminal bud, being thus converted into leaders, produce two\n",
      "and sometimes three leading branches, giving the tree some of the\n",
      "characters of the deciduous species. The white pine is not improved by a\n",
      "similar accident, as it loses thereby the expression of grandeur that\n",
      "comes from the length and size of its lateral branches, which are always\n",
      "diminished by coming from two or more leading shafts. Michaux remarks\n",
      "that when Pitch-Pines â€œgrow in masses, the cones are dispersed singly\n",
      "over the branches, and they shed their seeds the first autumn after they\n",
      "mature. But on solitary trees the cones are collected in groups of four\n",
      "or five, or even a larger number, and will remain on the trees, closed,\n",
      "for several years.â€\n",
      "\n",
      "The Pitch Pine abounds all along the coast from Massachusetts to the\n",
      "Carolinas; but it is rare in the northern parts of Maine and New\n",
      "Hampshire and north of these States. It is said to have been very\n",
      "abundant in the southern part of New England before the eighteenth\n",
      "century, but large forests of it were consumed in making tar for\n",
      "exportation to Great Britain. The Pitch Pine woods of the present day\n",
      "consist of small stunted trees, showing by their inferior thrift that\n",
      "they stand upon an exhausted soil.\n",
      "\n",
      "The trees of this species, for the most part too homely and rough to\n",
      "please the sight, are not generally admired as objects in the landscape;\n",
      "but there is a variety in their shapes that makes amends for their want\n",
      "of comeliness and gives them a marked importance in scenery. We do not\n",
      "in general sufficiently estimate the value of homely objects among the\n",
      "scenes of nature, though they are indeed the groundwork of all charming\n",
      "scenery, and set off to advantage the beauty of more comely objects.\n",
      "They give rest and relief to the eye, after it has felt the stimulus of\n",
      "beautiful forms and colors, that would soon pall upon the sense; and\n",
      "they leave imagination free to dress the scene according to our own\n",
      "fancy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence I am led to prize many a homely tree as possessing a high value,\n",
      "by exalting our susceptibility to beauty, and by relieving nature of\n",
      "that monotony which is so apparent when all the objects in a scene are\n",
      "beautiful. We see this monotony in all dressed grounds of considerable\n",
      "extent. We soon become weary of their ever-flowing lines of grace and\n",
      "elegance, and the harmonious blending of forms and colors introduced by\n",
      "art. This principle explains the difficulty of reading a whole volume\n",
      "written in verse. We soon weary of luxuries; and after strolling in\n",
      "grounds laid out in gaudy flower-beds and smooth shaven lawn, the tired\n",
      "eye rests with tranquil delight upon rude pastures bounded by loose\n",
      "stone-walls, and hills embroidered with ferns and covered with boulders.\n",
